# Local-Citation-Network

This web app aims to help scientists with their literature review using metadata from [OpenAlex](https://openalex.org/) (OA), [Semantic Scholar](https://semanticscholar.org/) (S2) and [Crossref](https://crossref.org/) (CR). Academic papers cite one another, thus creating a [citation network (= graph)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation_graph). Each node (= vertex) represents an article and each edge (= link / arrow) represents a reference / citation. Citation graphs are a topic of [bibliometrics, for which other great software exists as well](https://timwoelfle.github.io/Local-Citation-Network#bibliometrics).

This web app visualizes subsets of the global citation network that I call 'local citation networks', defined by the references (and citations) of a given set of input articles. In addition, the locally most relevant references (and citations) missing in the set of input articles are suggested for further review. 

## Open source contributions

This project is open source (GPL-3). I don't have much more time to work on this project, so I'm actively looking for help and contributors! Bugfixes are always welcome but please contact me before any large pull-requests so we can coordinate.

## FAQ
