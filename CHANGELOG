24.06.2022 v0.991
! Remove duplicate input articles not only for S2 but also other source APIs
! Fix bug in "Filter articles" function some articles are lacking a title

15.05.2022 v0.99
* When individual API calls fail in OpenAlex / Semantic Scholar, it now returns all the remaining articles instead of failing completely
* Error messages are now messages (Buefy "toasts") instead of blocking alerts
* Always allow editing list of DOIs before importing
! Ordering of articles from a list of DOIs now works correctly even when these DOIs are lowercase or have trailing strings like "doi:" or "https://doi.org/" (e.g. coming from Zotero Cita)
! Always reload source in clickOpenReferences to avoid source not having citations property anymore and causing errors with Semantic Scholar

10.03.2022 v0.98
+ Added support for OpenAlex (OA), the successor of Microsoft Academic, which brings back its high coverage, speed and abstract support. Also allows search by different id types (including PMID)
+ Open Alex supports highlighting retracted papers, e.g. when opening source doi:10.3390/en14227745 (flags can be missing though)
+ Added support for Semantic Scholar (S2), which is a bit slower than OA but allows easy implentation of "Outgoing suggestions". Also allows search by even more id types (including PMID, ARXIV)
* Deactivated OpenCitations (OC) option by default due to instability of its metadata API, it can still be activated through FAQ "Which APIs are supported?"
* Updated examples and FAQ to showcase new APIs
* Show API in tag labels
* Rotate citation network 90Â° clockwise when fullscreen toggled so widescreen space is used more efficiently
* Bumped Vue, Buefy and vis.js Network to newest versions
! Cannot highlight edges by clicking anymore
! Avoid duplicate counting of references for in-degree (e.g. https://api.crossref.org/works/10.7717/PEERJ.3544 has 5 references to DOI 10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108)
! Avoid showing Vue template before site is mounted with v-cloak

+ Allow users to input source article by Microsoft Academic Id, useful for arxiv and conference papers (#1 dukebw)
+ Added "Out-Degree" columns in tables showing the number of input articles cited
* Renamed "Suggested articles" to "Incoming suggestions", use up-pointing triangle instead of star in citation network
* Node-size in citation network now depends on sum of in-degree and out-degree, not just in-degree
* Include source article in "Input articles" table and citation network (as diamond)
* Show references among suggested articles in citation network (they still don't count towards in- and out-degree though)
* Include used API in localStorage and "link to share" function
* Updated examples to showcase all 3 APIs
* Perform API calls via fetch, remove Axios
* Bumped Vue to v2.6.12, Buefy to v0.9.4 and vis.js Network to 9.0.3
