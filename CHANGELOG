26.04.2023 v1.1
+ It's now possible to download a network as a JSON file and reload it through the "File" button.
+ Added white background to networks' canvas so they can now properly be saved by right-click → "Open/Save Image".
+ Added option to also show first names after last names in node labels for Co-authorship network.
+ Added "Incoming suggestions" to OpenAlex experimentally (activate by running "vm.retrieveIncomingCitationsOA = true" in browser console).
* Authors are now again distinguished by their names in the Co-authorship network and not by their hidden internal OpenAlex (OA) / Semantic Scholar (S2) ID due to seemingly many duplicates.
! Fixed first/last name detection when name was formatted "last name, first name".

10.12.2022 v1.0
+ CSV export of input articles / incoming suggestions / outgoing suggestions is now possible.
+ Network configurator provided by vis.js can now be accessed in modal "network settings" pane (https://visjs.github.io/vis-network/docs/network/).
+ Added support for PubMed IDs (PMID) in bookmarklet, which can thus now be used on PubMed (https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
+ Bookmarklet now also correctly sets source article (diamond in both citation and co-authorship networks).
+ Nodes in citation network can now optionally be colored by journal.
+ Node size in citation network can now optionally reflect in-degree/out-degree only (default: sum of both).
+ Source article node can now optionally be hidden in citation network.
+ Using Semantic Scholar (S2) now provides reference contexts in article details in input articles table (experimental!).
+ Show more author information when available: affiliation, links to ORCID, homepage, Google Scholar.
* Both citation network and co-authorship now show multiple node labels depending on scale. When no article is selected, all labels are shown now. Citation network scales up selected node for highlighting.
* Now show progress bars when loading new sources.
* Wait 2 minutes when network errors occur (or 429 errors caused by too rapid requests).
* Doubleclick now opens author information in co-authorship network.
* Crossref (CR) and the reactivated OpenCitations (OC) now send one request per paper, resulting in more stability.
* Loading of incoming / outgoing suggestions is now indicated by loading wheels.
* Load examples from .json and not .js file, allow the manual caching of networks as .json.
* Routing GitHub pages to root folder now and removed the unintuitive "docs" folder which formerly contained the live version.
* Bumped Vue, Buefy and vis.js Network to newest versions.
! Fixed bug when using S2: journals were not loaded correctly.
! Fixed suggestions when API is changed before they finish loading.

24.06.2022 v0.991
! Remove duplicate input articles not only for S2 but also other source APIs
! Fix bug in "Filter articles" function: some articles are lacking a title

15.05.2022 v0.99
* When individual API calls fail in OpenAlex / Semantic Scholar, it now returns all the remaining articles instead of failing completely
* Error messages are now messages (Buefy "toasts") instead of blocking alerts
* Always allow editing list of DOIs before importing
! Ordering of articles from a list of DOIs now works correctly even when these DOIs are lowercase or have trailing strings like "doi:" or "https://doi.org/" (e.g. coming from Zotero Cita)
! Always reload source in clickOpenReferences to avoid source not having citations property anymore and causing errors with Semantic Scholar

10.03.2022 v0.98
+ Added support for OpenAlex (OA), the successor of Microsoft Academic, which brings back its high coverage, speed and abstract support. Also allows search by different id types (including PMID)
+ Open Alex supports highlighting retracted papers, e.g. when opening source doi:10.3390/en14227745 (flags can be missing though)
+ Added support for Semantic Scholar (S2), which is a bit slower than OA but allows easy implentation of "Outgoing suggestions". Also allows search by even more id types (including PMID, ARXIV)
* Deactivated OpenCitations (OC) option by default due to instability of its metadata API, it can still be activated through FAQ "Which APIs are supported?"
* Updated examples and FAQ to showcase new APIs
* Show API in tag labels
* Rotate citation network 90° clockwise when fullscreen toggled so widescreen space is used more efficiently
* Bumped Vue, Buefy and vis.js Network to newest versions
! Cannot highlight edges by clicking anymore
! Avoid duplicate counting of references for in-degree (e.g. https://api.crossref.org/works/10.7717/PEERJ.3544 has 5 references to DOI 10.1080/00031305.2016.1154108)
! Avoid showing Vue template before site is mounted with v-cloak

02.01.2022 v0.97
- Removed Microsoft Academic option, which was discontinued in 2022

20.03.2021 v0.96
+ Added support for OpenCitations API (#2 no-identd)
+ Suggest "Outgoing suggestions" for queries performed with OpenCitations API (down-pointing triangle in citation network)
+ Allow users to select the number of "Incoming suggestions" and "Outgoing suggestions" shown (max. 20 each)
+ Allow users to input source article by Microsoft Academic Id, useful for arxiv and conference papers (#1 dukebw)
+ Added "Out-Degree" columns in tables showing the number of input articles cited
* Renamed "Suggested articles" to "Incoming suggestions", use up-pointing triangle instead of star in citation network
* Node-size in citation network now depends on sum of in-degree and out-degree, not just in-degree
* Include source article in "Input articles" table and citation network (as diamond)
* Show references among suggested articles in citation network (they still don't count towards in- and out-degree though)
* Include used API in localStorage and "link to share" function
* Updated examples to showcase all 3 APIs
* Perform API calls via fetch, remove Axios
* Bumped Vue to v2.6.12, Buefy to v0.9.4 and vis.js Network to 9.0.3
! Fixed estimation of "respective average reference completeness" for Crossref
! Parse DOIs in files more robustly (ignoring whitespace)

01.06.2020 v0.95
+ Added bookmarklet

03.05.2020 v0.94
+ Allows users to send links with lists of DOIs
+ Show numbering of articles when showing custom list (e.g. from file or link) or when using Crossref (which preserves reference numbering from original article, whereas Microsoft Academic doesn't preserve original numbering)
+ Allows users to edit lists of DOIs when reading files
+ Add fullscreen network mode
* Show title and journal in citation network node labels
* Open article link in new window when double-clicking articles in citation network
* Bumped Vue to v2.6.11 and Buefy to v0.8.17
! Fix layout on smartphones
! Parse DOIs in files more robustly (ignoring trailing fullstop and semicolon)
! Default DOIs to uppercase as is standard

09.04.2020 v0.93
