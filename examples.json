The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.","isRetracted":false,"isSource":true,"customListOfReferences":["pmid:11302887","pmid:15158637","pmid:15158638","pmid:15705458","pmid:11600885","pmid:12642066","pmid:12727138","pmid:15705441","pmid:11159626","pmid:15026468","pmid:10866211","ISBN-13-978-0195083774","pmid:15470193","pmid:6528136","pmid:10694730","pmid:7618077","pmid:10521349","pmid:11323066","pmid:15545678","pmid:10532877","pmid:10584742","pmid:10789670","pmid:10755072","pmid:8015123","pmid:15161896","pmid:9693346","pmid:11405896","pmid:1535110","pmid:15878467","pmid:14602436","pmid:15057290","10.1093/BIOMET/44.1-2.187","10.1093/BIOMET/44.3-4.533","pmid:11434499","10.1056/NEJME048225","pmid:16014596","pmid:14584715"]},"input":[{"id":"W2060512257","numberInSourceReferences":32,"doi":"10.1093/BIOMET/44.1-2.187","type":"article","title":"A STATISTICAL PARADOX","authors":[{"id":"A5011148732","LN":"Lindley","FN":"D.

The US Public Health Service and the National Science Foundation issued regulations effective October 1, 1995, regarding the disclosure of financial interests in the submission of grant proposals. Several scientific journals have also established pertinent policies for authors and editors. The objectives of this study were: (1) to select a set of published articles and observe the degree to which a sample of authors hold a financial interest in areas related to their research that are reportable under current standards, and (2) to examine the hypothesis that significant numbers of authors of articles in life science and biomedical journals have verifiable financial interests that might be important for journal editors and readers to know. This paper measures the frequency of selected financial interests held among lead authors of certain types of scientific publications and assesses disclosure practices of authors and journals. &lt;b&gt;Method:&lt;/b&gt; These objectives were applied to a pilot study of Massachusetts academic scientists who were cited as first or last author in at least one article published in 1992 in 14 leading journals of cell or molecular biology and medicine. We created a database of every original article published in 1992 by 14 leading life science and biomedical journals, supplemented by data sets consisting of (1) Massachusetts biotechnology firms, including their officers and scientific advisory boards, and (2) scientists listed as inventors on patents or patent applications registered with the World Intellectual Property Organization. &lt;b&gt;Results:&lt;/b&gt; We examined 1,105 university authors (first and last cited) from Massachusetts institutions whose 789 articles, published in 1992, appeared in 14 scientific and medical journals. Authors are said to ‘possess a financial interest’ if they are listed as inventors in a patent or patent application closely related to their published work; serve on a scientific advisory board of a biotechnology company; or are officers, directors, or major shareholders (beneficial owner of 10% or more of stock issued) in a firm that has commercial interests related to their research. Applying the criteria to the reference population of journals and Massachusetts academic authors, we measured the following frequencies for lead authors: 0.20 for serving on a scientific advisory board; 0.07 for being an officer, director, or major shareholder in a biotechnology firm, and 0.22 for being listed as an inventor in a related patent or patent application. The joint frequency of articles in the journals reviewed with a lead author that meets one of the three conditions is 0.34. &lt;b&gt;Conclusions:&lt;/b&gt; One of every three articles in our sample has at least one Massachusetts-based author with a financial interest, and 15% of the authors in our sample have a financial interest relevant to one of their publications. For the year 1992, the rate of published voluntary disclosures of financial interest (as defined in our study) is virtually zero, but relatively few scientific and biomedical journals at that time required any such disclosure to journal editors and reviewers. Further research is needed to determine the effectiveness of mandatory disclosure requirements by some journals.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4300811467","numberInSourceReferences":20,"type":"article","title":"ICH Harmonised Tripartite Guideline.

In conference, the group was asked to identify items they thought should be included in a checklist of standards. Whenever possible, checklist items were guided by research evidence suggesting that failure to adhere to the item proposed could lead to biased results. A modified Delphi technique was used in assessing candidate items.The conference resulted in the QUOROM statement, a checklist, and a flow diagram. The checklist describes our preferred way to present the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of a report of a meta-analysis. It is organised into 21 headings and subheadings regarding searches, selection, validity assessment, data abstraction, study characteristics, and quantitative data synthesis, and in the results with \"trial flow\", study characteristics, and quantitative data synthesis; research documentation was identified for eight of the 18 items. The flow diagram provides information about both the numbers of RCTs identified, included, and excluded and the reasons for exclusion of trials.We hope this report will generate further thought about ways to improve the quality of reports of meta-analyses of RCTs and that interested readers, reviewers, researchers, and editors will use the QUOROM statement and generate ideas for its improvement.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2109363337","numberInSourceReferences":17,"doi":"10.1126/SCIENCE.286.5439.531","type":"article","title":"Molecular Classification of Cancer: Class Discovery and Class Prediction by Gene Expression Monitoring","authors":[{"id":"A5001449157","LN":"Golub","FN":"Todd R.","affil":"Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (US), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US), Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (US), Harvard University (US)"},{"id":"A5074883462","orcid":"0000-0003-3357-437X","LN":"Slonim","FN":"Donna K.","affil":"Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (US), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US)"},{"id":"A5017114712","orcid":"0000-0002-9360-4668","LN":"Tamayo","FN":"Pablo","affil":"Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (US), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US)"},{"id":"A5085557525","LN":"Huard","FN":"Christine","affil":"Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (US), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US)"},{"id":"A5091848368","LN":"Gaasenbeek","FN":"Michelle","affil":"Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (US), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US)"},{"id":"A5077622597","orcid":"0000-0002-9755-2818","LN":"Mesirov","FN":"Jill P.","affil":"Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (US), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US)"},{"id":"A5046514514","orcid":"0000-0003-0992-6494","LN":"Coller","FN":"Hilary A.","affil":"Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research (US), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (US)"},{"id":"A5010840699","orcid":"0000-0003-4099-4700","LN":"Loh","FN":"Mignon L.","affil":"Dana-Farber Cancer Institute (US), Harvard University (US)"},{"id":"A5015143631","LN":"Downing","FN":"James R.","affil":"St. Jude Children's Research Hospital (US)"},{"id":"A5001226520","LN":"Caligiuri","FN":"M.

Aims To determine whether such an association existed in schizophrenia trials. Method Three hundred trials were randomly selected from the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group's Register. All comparisons between treatment groups and control groups using rating scales were identified. The publication status of each scale was determined and claims of a significant treatment effect were recorded. Results Trials were more likely to report that a treatment was superior to control when an unpublished scale was used to make the comparison (relative risk 1.37 (95% C11.12–1.68)). This effect increased when a ‘gold-standard’ definition of treatment superiority was applied (RR 1.94 (95% C11.35–2.79)). In non-pharmacological trials, one-third of ‘gold-standard’ claims of treatment superiority would not have been made if published scales had been used.

Meta-analyses are increasingly used to address this problem, and they often evaluate observational studies. A workshop was held in Atlanta, Ga, in April 1997, to examine the reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies and to make recommendations to aid authors, reviewers, editors, and readers.Twenty-seven participants were selected by a steering committee, based on expertise in clinical practice, trials, statistics, epidemiology, social sciences, and biomedical editing. Deliberations of the workshop were open to other interested scientists. Funding for this activity was provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.We conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the conduct and reporting of meta-analyses in observational studies using MEDLINE, Educational Research Information Center (ERIC), PsycLIT, and the Current Index to Statistics. We also examined reference lists of the 32 studies retrieved and contacted experts in the field. Participants were assigned to small-group discussions on the subjects of bias, searching and abstracting, heterogeneity, study categorization, and statistical methods.From the material presented at the workshop, the authors developed a checklist summarizing recommendations for reporting meta-analyses of observational studies. The checklist and supporting evidence were circulated to all conference attendees and additional experts. All suggestions for revisions were addressed.The proposed checklist contains specifications for reporting of meta-analyses of observational studies in epidemiology, including background, search strategy, methods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Use of the checklist should improve the usefulness of meta-analyses for authors, reviewers, editors, readers, and decision makers. An evaluation plan is suggested and research areas are explored.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1551600243","numberInSourceReferences":11,"doi":"10.1038/35015718","type":"article","title":"Searching for genetic determinants in the new millennium","authors":[{"id":"A5085936676","orcid":"0000-0002-4126-2061","LN":"Risch","FN":"Neil","affil":"Stanford University (US)"}],"year":2000,"date":"2000-06-01","journal":"Nature (Nature Portfolio)","volume":"405","issue":"6788","firstPage":"847","lastPage":"856","references":["W127014378","W1557152547","W1711580613","W1963936426","W1968664402","W1976741643","W1981508667","W1984236058","W1984737558","W1998915014","W2000848664","W2002605005","W2002835979","W2008047653","W2012768252","W2042103448","W2051008597","W2059543915","W2061784450","W2074754379","W2089221493","W2091912105","W2093282076","W2094021406","W2096051150","W2116329478","W2117359474","W2120329743","W2124277514","W2160782760","W2169556112","W2268513284","W2396140944","W2578765318","W4240660705","W4254753097"],"referencesCount":36,"citationsCount":1794,"isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2062248680","numberInSourceReferences":1,"doi":"10.1136/BMJ.322.7291.879","type":"article","title":"Any casualties in the clash of randomised and observational evidence?","authors":[{"id":"A5070446713","LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

Two recent reports, however, identified clinical questions (19 in one report,1 five in the other2) where both randomised trials and observational methods had been used to evaluate the same question, and performed a head to head comparison of them. In contrast to the belief that randomised controlled trials are more reliable estimators of how much a treatment works, both reports found that observational studies did not overestimate the size of the treatment effect compared with their randomised counterparts. The authors say that the merits of well designed observational studies may need to be re-evaluated: case-control and cohort studies may need to assume more respect in assessing medical therapies and largescale observational databases should be better exploited. 1 2 The first claim flies in the face of half a century of thinking, so are these authors right?\n\nThe combined results from the two reports indeed show a striking concordance between the estimates obtained with the two research designs.

That goal can be achieved only through total transparency from authors. Despite several decades of educational efforts, the reporting of RCTs needs improvement. Investigators and editors developed the original CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to help authors improve reporting by use of a checklist and flow diagram. The revised CONSORT statement presented here incorporates new evidence and addresses some criticisms of the original statement. The checklist items pertain to the content of the Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. The revised checklist includes 22 items selected because empirical evidence indicates that not reporting this information is associated with biased estimates of treatment effect, or because the information is essential to judge the reliability or relevance of the findings. We intended the flow diagram to depict the passage of participants through an RCT. The revised flow diagram depicts information from four stages of a trial (enrolment, intervention allocation, followup, and analysis).

This is perhaps particularly the case with respect to epidemiological findings that suggest that some aspect of everyday life is bad for people.

If only positive findings are published then they may be mistakenly considered to be of importance rather than being the necessary chance results produced by the application of criteria for meaningfulness based on statistical significance. As many studies contain long questionnaires collecting information on hundreds of variables, and measure a wide range of potential outcomes, several false positive findings are virtually guaranteed. The high volume and often contradictory nature5 of medical research findings, however, is not only because of publication bias.

The traditional approach is to control the probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis, the familywise error rate (FWE). To improve the power of detecting treatment differences, an alternative approach is to control the expected proportion of errors among the rejected hypotheses, the false discovery rate (FDR). When some of the hypotheses are not true, the error rate from either the FWE- or the FDR-controlling procedure is usually lower than the designed level. This paper compares five methods used to estimate the number of true null hypotheses over a large number of hypotheses. The estimated number of true null hypotheses is then used to improve the power of FWE- or FDR-controlling methods. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of these methods. The lowest slope method, developed by Benjamini and Hochberg (2000) on the adaptive control of the FDR in multiple testing with independent statistics, and the mean of differences method appear to perform the best. These two methods control the FWE properly when the number of nontrue null hypotheses is small. A data set from a toxicogenomic microarray experiment is used for illustration.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2094934696","numberInSourceReferences":7,"doi":"10.1016/S1471-4914(03)00030-3","type":"article","title":"Genetic associations: false or true?","authors":[{"id":"A5070446713","LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

We systematically assessed the predictive performance of this method for major clinical outcomes (death, metastasis, recurrence, response to therapy) and the correlation of gene profiling with other clinicopathological correlates of malignant disorders. Methods Eligible reports retrieved from MEDLINE (1995 to April, 2003) were assessed for features of study design, reported predictive performance, and consideration of other prognostic factors. We searched for study variables that increased the chances that a significant association with a clinical outcome or correlate would be found. Findings 84 eligible studies were identified, of which 30 addressed major clinical outcomes. A median of 25 (IQR 15–45) patients with cancer were included. Among the studies of major clinical outcomes, nine did cross-validation but it was complete in only two of them; six studies used independent validation of supervised predictive models. Smaller studies showed better sensitivity and specificity for clinical outcomes than larger studies. Only 11 studies addressing major clinical outcomes did subgroup or adjusted analyses for other prognostic factors. Across all 84 studies, significant associations were 3·5 (95% CI 1·5–8·0) times more likely per doubling of sample size and 9·7 (2·0–47·0) times more likely per ten-fold increase in microarray probes. Interpretation DNA microarrays addressing cancer outcomes show variable prognostic performance. Larger studies with appropriate clinical design, adjustment for known predictors, and proper validation are essential for this highly promising technology.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2106631668","numberInSourceReferences":6,"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(03)12715-8","type":"article","title":"Problems of reporting genetic associations with complex outcomes","authors":[{"id":"A5005414020","orcid":"0000-0002-8345-3288","LN":"Colhoun","FN":"Helen M.","affil":"University College London (GB)"},{"id":"A5039750697","orcid":"0000-0002-5217-1034","LN":"McKeigue","FN":"Paul","affil":"London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine (GB)"},{"id":"A5013184354","orcid":"0000-0002-1407-8314","LN":"Smith","FN":"George Davey","affil":"University of Bristol (GB)"}],"year":2003,"date":"2003-03-01","journal":"Lancet (Elsevier BV)","volume":"361","issue":"9360","firstPage":"865","lastPage":"872","references":["W1522239197","W1541152614","W1583476286","W1690786713","W1963936426","W1964871265","W1971604012","W1976741643","W1976943968","W1977057551","W1977958337","W1982733535","W1990250261","W1993671038","W1994834210","W1998578820","W2001587667","W2009213685","W2013688320","W2014271461","W2018480908","W2019860224","W2025306791","W2025651303","W2033240204","W2033360275","W2042103448","W2056924301","W2057420075","W2060015298","W2074296111","W2090897293","W2095186368","W2095833232","W2098980155","W2109921650","W2110343195","W2123184366","W2128365639","W2128463395","W2134070988","W2145124350","W2152445275","W2152924180","W2154549963","W2157823046","W2214291492","W2230430502","W2254057084","W2319089463","W4230993889","W4252173430","W4253515115"],"referencesCount":53,"citationsCount":1155,"abstract":"Inability to replicate many results has led to increasing scepticism about the value of simple association study designs for detection of genetic variants contributing to common complex traits.

They are essential for our knowledge about causes and pathogenesis—eg, genetic, environmental, or infectious causes of disease. Additionally, for medical practice we rely on observational studies of prognosis and diagnosis. Nevertheless, over the past years, we have seen recurrent debates about the merit of observational versus randomised research. The debates have been fuelled recently because of seeming total failures, in which the results of observational studies were completely overturned by randomised studies. Hormone replacement therapy showed protection from myocardial infarction in observational studies, but a small increase was seen in randomised trials; a similar reversal happened for β carotene and lung cancer. Such discrepancies raise the question: in what circumstances can observational comparisons be as convincing as randomised experiments? To answer that question: I will first recall what is expected from randomisation. I will then describe two specific issues, adverse effects of drugs and genetic causes of disease, to elucidate under what circumstances evidence from observational research is as good as that from randomised trials. This description can be generalised to other areas of clinical and epidemiological research, and leads to a proposal for a three-pronged restriction to give observational research the best chance to be as credible as randomised controlled trials. Beyond randomised versus observational studiesIn this week's Lancet, Debbie Lawlor and colleagues and Jan Vandenbroucke discuss the role of observational studies and randomised controlled trials in patient-oriented research. Lawlor and colleagues urge a more careful approach to observational studies, such as adjusting for all measured potential confounding variables, including exposures in early life (or subsequent adult biomarkers), and mathematical sensitivity analyses of unmeasured confounders. Vandenbroucke, addressing the same issue, suggests a three-pronged restriction of observational studies, in terms of research topics (such as adverse events), study design (for types of exposure), and analysis (when adjusting for confounding factors).

Protocols and published articles were also compared to identify discrepancies in primary outcomes.Main Outcome MeasuresCompleteness of reporting of efficacy and harm outcomes and of statistically significant vs nonsignificant outcomes; consistency between primary outcomes defined in the most recent protocols and those defined in published articles.ResultsOne hundred two trials with 122 published journal articles and 3736 outcomes were identified. Overall, 50% of efficacy and 65% of harm outcomes per trial were incompletely reported. Statistically significant outcomes had a higher odds of being fully reported compared with nonsignificant outcomes for both efficacy (pooled odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-4.0) and harm (pooled odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.8-12.0) data. In comparing published articles with protocols, 62% of trials had at least 1 primary outcome that was changed, introduced, or omitted. Eighty-six percent of survey responders (42/49) denied the existence of unreported outcomes despite clear evidence to the contrary.ConclusionsThe reporting of trial outcomes is not only frequently incomplete but also biased and inconsistent with protocols. Published articles, as well as reviews that incorporate them, may therefore be unreliable and overestimate the benefits of an intervention. To ensure transparency, planned trials should be registered and protocols should be made publicly available prior to trial completion.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2135010675","numberInSourceReferences":35,"doi":"10.1056/NEJME048225","type":"article","title":"Clinical Trial Registration: A Statement from the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors","authors":[{"id":"A5007034498","LN":"Angelis","FN":"Catherine De"},{"id":"A5021045413","LN":"Drazen","FN":"Jeffrey M."},{"id":"A5064756982","orcid":"0000-0002-0739-4802","LN":"Frizelle","FN":"Frank"},{"id":"A5066174749","orcid":"0000-0001-8217-7376","LN":"Haug","FN":"Charlotte"},{"id":"A5069736521","LN":"Hoey","FN":"John"},{"id":"A5082599575","orcid":"0000-0003-1792-5408","LN":"Horton","FN":"Richard"},{"id":"A5024546430","LN":"Kotzin","FN":"Sheldon"},{"id":"A5007419827","orcid":"0000-0002-9652-1307","LN":"Lainé","FN":"Christine"},{"id":"A5046187244","orcid":"0000-0001-6272-0917","LN":"Marušić","FN":"Ana"},{"id":"A5082002328","LN":"Overbeke","FN":"A.

A major reason for this unfortunate situation is the strategy of declaring statistical significance based on a P value alone, particularly, any P value below.05. The false positive report probability (FPRP), the probability of no true association between a genetic variant and disease given a statistically significant finding, depends not only on the observed P value but also on both the prior probability that the association between the genetic variant and the disease is real and the statistical power of the test. In this commentary, we show how to assess the FPRP and how to use it to decide whether a finding is deserving of attention or \"noteworthy.\" We show how this approach can lead to improvements in the design, analysis, and interpretation of molecular epidemiology studies. Our proposal can help investigators, editors, and readers of research articles to protect themselves from overinterpreting statistically significant findings that are not likely to signify a true association. An FPRP-based criterion for deciding whether to call a finding noteworthy formalizes the process already used informally by investigators--that is, tempering enthusiasm for remarkable study findings with considerations of plausibility.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1575982426","numberInSourceReferences":31,"doi":"10.1038/NRC1322","type":"review","title":"Rules of evidence for cancer molecular-marker discovery and validation","authors":[{"id":"A5059344025","orcid":"0000-0002-2200-039X","LN":"Ransohoff","FN":"David F.","affil":"University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill (US)"}],"year":2004,"date":"2004-04-01","journal":"Nature reviews.

Because CONSORT primarily aimed at improving the quality of reporting of efficacy, only 1 checklist item specifically addressed the reporting of safety. Considerable evidence suggests that reporting of harms-related data from RCTs also needs improvement. Members of the CONSORT Group, including journal editors and scientists, met in Montebello, Quebec, Canada, in May 2003 to address this problem. The result is the following document: the standard CONSORT checklist with 10 new recommendations about reporting harms-related issues, accompanying explanation, and examples to highlight specific aspects of proper reporting. We hope that this document, in conjunction with other CONSORT-related materials (http://www.consort-statement.org), will help authors improve their reporting of harms-related data from RCTs. Better reporting will help readers critically appraise and interpret trial results.

Knowledge of this gene-expression profile or molecular signature should improve treatment of patients by allowing treatment to be tailored to the severity of the disease. We reanalysed data from the seven largest published studies that have attempted to predict prognosis of cancer patients on the basis of DNA microarray analysis.The standard strategy is to identify a molecular signature (ie, the subset of genes most differentially expressed in patients with different outcomes) in a training set of patients and to estimate the proportion of misclassifications with this signature on an independent validation set of patients. We expanded this strategy (based on unique training and validation sets) by using multiple random sets, to study the stability of the molecular signature and the proportion of misclassifications.The list of genes identified as predictors of prognosis was highly unstable; molecular signatures strongly depended on the selection of patients in the training sets. For all but one study, the proportion misclassified decreased as the number of patients in the training set increased. Because of inadequate validation, our chosen studies published overoptimistic results compared with those from our own analyses. Five of the seven studies did not classify patients better than chance.The prognostic value of published microarray results in cancer studies should be considered with caution.

We consider how to validate a model and suggest that it is desirable to consider two rather different aspects – statistical and clinical validity – and examine some general approaches to validation. We illustrate the issues using several case studies.

We hypothesized that controversial data are attractive to investigators and editors, and thus the most extreme, opposite results would appear very early rather than late, as data accumulate, provided data can be generated rapidly. Methods We used data from MEDLINE-indexed meta-analyses of case–control studies on genetic associations (retrospective, hypothesis-generating research with usually rapid turnaround) and meta-analyses of randomized trials of health care interventions (prospective, targeted research that usually takes longer) sampled from the Cochrane Library. Using cumulative meta-analysis, we evaluated how the between-study variance for studies on the same question changed over time and at what point the studies with the most extreme results ever observed had been published. Results The maximal between-study variance was more likely to be recorded early in the 44 eligible meta-analyses of genetic associations than in the 37 meta-analyses of health care interventions (P = .013). At the time of the first heterogeneity assessment, the most favorable-ever result in support of a specific association was more likely to appear than the least favorable-ever result (22 vs. 10, P = .017); the opposite was seen at the second heterogeneity assessment (15 vs. 5, P = .031). Such a sequence of extreme opposite results was not seen in the clinical trials meta-analyses. The estimated between-study variance decreased over time in genetic association studies (P = .010), but not in clinical trials (P = .30). Conclusion In contrast to prospective trials, a rapid early sequence of extreme, opposite results is frequent in retrospective hypothesis-generating molecular research.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2081814119","numberInSourceReferences":36,"doi":"10.1001/JAMA.294.2.218","type":"article","title":"Contradicted and Initially Stronger Effects in Highly Cited Clinical Research","authors":[{"id":"A5070446713","LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

Controversies are most prominent when high-impact research is involved.ObjectivesTo understand how frequently highly cited studies are contradicted or find effects that are stronger than in other similar studies and to discern whether specific characteristics are associated with such refutation over time.DesignAll original clinical research studies published in 3 major general clinical journals or high-impact-factor specialty journals in 1990-2003 and cited more than 1000 times in the literature were examined.Main Outcome MeasureThe results of highly cited articles were compared against subsequent studies of comparable or larger sample size and similar or better controlled designs. The same analysis was also performed comparatively for matched studies that were not so highly cited.ResultsOf 49 highly cited original clinical research studies, 45 claimed that the intervention was effective. Of these, 7 (16%) were contradicted by subsequent studies, 7 others (16%) had found effects that were stronger than those of subsequent studies, 20 (44%) were replicated, and 11 (24%) remained largely unchallenged. Five of 6 highly-cited nonrandomized studies had been contradicted or had found stronger effects vs 9 of 39 randomized controlled trials (P = .008). Among randomized trials, studies with contradicted or stronger effects were smaller (P = .009) than replicated or unchallenged studies although there was no statistically significant difference in their early or overall citation impact. Matched control studies did not have a significantly different share of refuted results than highly cited studies, but they included more studies with “negative” results.ConclusionsContradiction and initially stronger effects are not unusual in highly cited research of clinical interventions and their outcomes. The extent to which high citations may provoke contradictions and vice versa needs more study. Controversies are most common with highly cited nonrandomized studies, but even the most highly cited randomized trials may be challenged and refuted over time, especially small ones.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2144981148","numberInSourceReferences":1,"doi":"10.1371/JOURNAL.PMED.0020124","type":"article","title":"Why Most Published Research Findings Are False","authors":[{"id":"A5085949499","orcid":"0000-0003-3118-6859","LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.","isRetracted":false,"isSource":true,"customListOfReferences":["pmid:11302887","pmid:15158637","pmid:15158638","pmid:15705458","pmid:11600885","pmid:12642066","pmid:12727138","pmid:15705441","pmid:11159626","pmid:15026468","pmid:10866211","ISBN-13-978-0195083774","pmid:15470193","pmid:6528136","pmid:10694730","pmid:7618077","pmid:10521349","pmid:11323066","pmid:15545678","pmid:10532877","pmid:10584742","pmid:10789670","pmid:10755072","pmid:8015123","pmid:15161896","pmid:9693346","pmid:11405896","pmid:1535110","pmid:15878467","pmid:14602436","pmid:15057290","10.1093/BIOMET/44.1-2.187","10.1093/BIOMET/44.3-4.533","pmid:11434499","10.1056/NEJME048225","pmid:16014596","pmid:14584715"]}],"incomingSuggestions":[{"id":"W1970046651","numberInSourceReferences":5,"doi":"10.1056/NEJM197809282991304","type":"article","title":"The Importance of Beta, the Type II Error and Sample Size in the Design and Interpretation of the Randomized Control Trial","authors":[{"id":"A5032189262","LN":"Freiman","FN":"Jennie A."},{"id":"A5065357436","LN":"Chalmers","FN":"Thomas C."},{"id":"A5073667857","LN":"Smith","FN":"H."},{"id":"A5066582206","LN":"Kuebler","FN":"Roy R."}],"year":1978,"date":"1978-09-28","journal":"New England journal of medicine/The New England journal of medicine (Massachusetts Medical Society)","volume":"299","issue":"13","firstPage":"690","lastPage":"694","references":["W2013256551","W2053040706","W4242605405"],"referencesCount":3,"citationsCount":1543,"abstract":"Seventy-one \"negative\" randomized control trials were re-examined to determine if the investigators had studied large enough samples to give a high probability (greater than 0.90) of detecting a 25 per cent and 50 per cent therapeutic improvement in the response.

In half of the trials, the effect variables in the methods and results sections were not the same, and the interpretation of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in the reports seemed to depend on whether a significant difference was found. Statistically significant results appeared in 93 reports (47%). In 73 trials they favored only the new drug, and in 8 only the active control. All 39 trials with a significant difference in side effects favored the new drug. Choice of dose, multiple comparisons, wrong calculation, subgroup and within-groups analyses, wrong sampling units (in 63% of trials for effect variables, in 23% for side effects), change in measurement scale before analysis, baseline difference, and selective reporting of significant results were some of the verified or possible causes for the large proportion of results that favored the new drug. Doubtful or invalid statements were found in 76% of the conclusions or abstracts. Bias consistently favored the new drug in 81 trials, and the control in only one trial. It is not obvious how a reliable meta-analysis could be done in these trials.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2112339576","numberInSourceReferences":1,"doi":"10.1016/0140-6736(91)90201-Y","type":"article","title":"Publication bias in clinical research","authors":[{"id":"A5058664398","orcid":"0000-0002-2603-5418","LN":"Easterbrook","FN":"Philippa","affil":"Johns Hopkins Medicine (US), Johns Hopkins University (US)"},{"id":"A5080135607","LN":"Gopalan","FN":"Radha","affil":"Johns Hopkins Medicine (US), Johns Hopkins University (US)"},{"id":"A5051242364","LN":"Berlin","FN":"Jesse A.","affil":"University of Pennsylvania (US)"},{"id":"A5011127007","orcid":"0000-0001-6504-0036","LN":"Matthews","FN":"David R.","affil":"John Radcliffe Hospital (GB)"}],"year":1991,"date":"1991-04-01","journal":"Lancet (Elsevier BV)","volume":"337","issue":"8746","firstPage":"867","lastPage":"872","references":["W1484475765","W1568844944","W1887056411","W1967186521","W1970046651","W1972617787","W1983413936","W1990339821","W2000967743","W2004121449","W2006546769","W2016526647","W2025078197","W2028299022","W2030192372","W2034992074","W2037887807","W2053664176","W2054305681","W2072113881","W2099257933","W2104312285","W2151970467","W2339695218","W4230870326"],"referencesCount":25,"citationsCount":2794,"abstract":"In a retrospective survey, 487 research projects approved by the Central Oxford Research Ethics Committee between 1984 and 1987, were studied for evidence of publication bias.

Studies with statistically significant results were more likely to be published than those finding no difference between the study groups (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.32; 95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.25-4.28). Studies with significant results were also more likely to lead to a greater number of publications and presentations and to be published in journals with a high citation impact factor. An increased likelihood of publication was also associated with a high rating by the investigator of the importance of the study results, and with increasing sample size. The tendency towards publication bias was greater with observational and laboratory-based experimental studies (OR = 3.79; 95% Cl = 1.47-9.76) than with randomised clinical trials (OR = 0.84; 95% Cl = 0.34-2.09). We have confirmed the presence of publication bias in a cohort of clinical research studies. These findings suggest that conclusions based only on a review of published data should be interpreted cautiously, especially for observational studies.

Performing a new meta-analysis whenever the results of a new trial of a particular therapy are published permits the study of trends in efficacy and makes it possible to determine when a new treatment appears to be significantly effective or deleterious. We describe the use of such a procedure, cumulative meta-analysis, to assess therapeutic trials among patients with myocardial infarction.We performed cumulative meta-analyses of clinical trials that evaluated 15 treatments and preventive measures for acute myocardial infarction.An example of this method is its application to the use of intravenous streptokinase as thrombolytic therapy for acute infarction. Thirty-three trials evaluating this therapy were performed between 1959 and 1988. We found that a consistent, statistically significant reduction in total mortality (odds ratios, 0.74; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.59 to 0.92) was achieved in 1973, after only eight trials involving 2432 patients had been completed. The results of the 25 subsequent trials, which enrolled an additional 34,542 patients through 1988, had little or no effect on the odds ratio establishing efficacy, but simply narrowed the 95 percent confidence interval. In particular, two very large trials, the Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Streptochinasi nell'Infarto Miocardico trial in 1986 (11,712 patients) and the Second International Study of Infarct Survival trial in 1988 (17,187 patients) did not modify the already established evidence of efficacy. We used a similar approach to study the accumulating evidence of efficacy (or lack of efficacy) of 14 other therapies and preventive measures for myocardial infarction.Cumulative meta-analysis of therapeutic trials facilitates the determination of clinical efficacy and harm and may be helpful in tracking trials, planning future trials, and making clinical recommendations for therapy.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W4233954896","numberInSourceReferences":8,"doi":"10.1001/JAMA.1996.03540080059030","type":"article","title":"Improving the Quality of Reporting of Randomized Controlled Trials","authors":[{"id":"A5079054289","orcid":"0000-0003-3772-1795","LN":"Begg","FN":"Colin B."}],"year":1996,"date":"1996-08-28","journal":"JAMA (American Medical Association)","volume":"276","issue":"8","firstPage":"637","lastPage":"637","references":[],"referencesCount":0,"citationsCount":2721,"abstract":"THE RANDOMIZED controlled trial (RCT), more than any other methodology, can have a powerful and immediate impact on patient care.

Other factors to consider in designing a study of allelic association are specification of gene action in a weakly parametric model, efficiency, diagnostic reliability for hypernormal individuals, interest in linkage and imprinting, and sibship composition. Family-based samples lend themselves to the TDT despite its inefficiency compared with cases and unrelated normal controls. The TDT has an efficiency of 1/2 for parent-offspring pairs and 2/3 for father-mother-child trios. Against cases and hypernormal controls, the efficiency is only 1/6 on the null hypothesis. Although dependent on marker gene frequency and other factors, efficiency for hypernormal controls is always greater than for random controls. Efficiency of the TDT is increased in multiplex families and by inclusion of normal sibs, approaching a case-control design with normal but not hypernormal controls. Isolated cases favor unrelated controls, and only in exceptional populations would avoidance of stratification justify a family-based design to map disease genes by allelic association.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2134338262","numberInSourceReferences":7,"doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(98)01085-X","type":"article","title":"Does quality of reports of randomised trials affect estimates of intervention efficacy reported in meta-analyses?","authors":[{"id":"A5068353058","orcid":"0000-0003-2434-4206","LN":"Moher","FN":"David","affil":"Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CA), University of Ottawa (CA)"},{"id":"A5066860826","LN":"Pham","FN":"Ba’","affil":"Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CA)"},{"id":"A5012359048","orcid":"0000-0002-7090-2953","LN":"Jones","FN":"Alison","affil":"Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CA)"},{"id":"A5084752934","orcid":"0000-0002-4087-543X","LN":"Cook","FN":"Deborah J.","affil":"McMaster University (CA)"},{"id":"A5040320731","orcid":"0000-0002-9591-5099","LN":"Jadad","FN":"Alejandro R.","affil":"McMaster University (CA)"},{"id":"A5034760307","LN":"Moher","FN":"M"},{"id":"A5022067453","orcid":"0000-0001-5062-0556","LN":"Tugwell","FN":"Peter","affil":"University of Ottawa (CA)"},{"id":"A5008250585","LN":"Klassen","FN":"Terry P","affil":"University of Ottawa (CA), Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CA)"}],"year":1998,"date":"1998-08-01","journal":"Lancet (Elsevier BV)","volume":"352","issue":"9128","firstPage":"609","lastPage":"613","references":["W1966814352","W1979494371","W1982130175","W1986215651","W1994898034","W1995574368","W1997549761","W2013594251","W2027294433","W2030958316","W2031385454","W2033238186","W2068139609","W2094302749","W2118266607","W2140359845","W2148410979","W2164777277","W2410734210","W2921865037","W4214559180","W4233568880","W4233954896","W4301115652","W4323283745","W4323284479"],"referencesCount":26,"citationsCount":3424,"abstract":"Background Few meta-analyses of randomised trials assess the quality of the studies included. Yet there is increasing evidence that trial quality can affect estimates of intervention efficacy. We investigated whether different methods of quality assessment provide different estimates of intervention efficacy evaluated in randomised controlled trials (RCTs). Methods We randomly selected 11 meta-analyses that involved 127 RCTs on the efficacy of interventions used for circulatory and digestive diseases, mental health, and pregnancy and childbirth. We replicated all the meta-analyses using published data from the primary studies. The quality of reporting of all 127 clinical trials was assessed by means of component and scale approaches. To explore the effects of quality on the quantitative results, we examined the effects of different methods of incorporating quality scores (sensitivity analysis and quality weights) on the results of the meta-analyses. Findings The quality of trials was low. Masked assessments provided significantly higher scores than unmasked assessments (mean 2·74 [SD 1·10] vs 2·55 [1·20]). Low-quality trials (score ·2), compared with high-quality trials (score >2), were associated with an increased estimate of benefit of 34% (ratio of odds ratios [ROR] 0·66 [95% CI 0·52–0·83]). Trials that used inadequate allocation concealment, compared with those that used adequate methods, were also associated with an increased estimate of benefit (37%; ROR=0·63 [0·45–0·88]). The average treatment benefit was 39% (odds ratio [OR] 0·61 [0·57–0·65]) for all trials, 52% (OR 0·48 [0·43–0·54]) for low-quality trials, and 29% (OR 0·71 [0·65–0·77]) for high-quality trials. Use of all the trial scores as quality weights reduced the effects to 35% (OR 0·65 [0·59–0·71]) and resulted in the least statistical heterogeneity. Interpretation Studies of low methodological quality in which the estimate of quality is incorporated into the meta-analyses can alter the interpretation of the benefit of intervention, whether a scale or component approach is used in the assessment of trial quality.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2103718021","numberInSourceReferences":4,"doi":"10.1001/JAMA.279.4.281","type":"article","title":"Effect of the Statistical Significance of Results on the Time to Completion and Publication of Randomized Efficacy Trials","authors":[{"id":"A5070446713","LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientifi c fi eld. In this framework, a research fi nding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a fi eld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater fl exibility in designs, defi nitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater fi nancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientifi c fi eld in chase of statistical signifi cance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientifi c fi elds, claimed research fi ndings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research. It can be proven that most claimed research fi ndings are false.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2147833650","numberInSourceReferences":9,"doi":"10.1111/J.1533-2500.2005.05302.X","type":"article","title":"Evidence-Based Medicine and the Challenge of Low Back Pain: Where Are We Now?","authors":[{"id":"A5070442023","orcid":"0000-0001-9889-8610","LN":"Chou","FN":"Roger","affil":"Oregon Health & Science University (US)"}],"year":2005,"date":"2005-08-23","journal":"Pain practice (Wiley-Blackwell)","volume":"5","issue":"3","firstPage":"153","lastPage":"178","references":["W1247968195","W137187125","W139620411","W1487432611","W1503995466","W1506774621","W1541581356","W1550275457","W1556793270","W1606982357","W1714052158","W1715602942","W188675448","W190432982","W1929168249","W1952978608","W1964796004","W1965603218","W1966827231","W1967092410","W1967103249","W1969065401","W1971177159","W1971348077","W1974689215","W1975373110","W1975769749","W1976541880","W1976663972","W1978296110","W1978868802","W1979285610","W1979423827","W1980300818","W1981970927","W1982130175","W1983003584","W1984234160","W1985546163","W1986167527","W1986215651","W1987610069","W1990986174","W1991596234","W1992637165","W1992882333","W1993590250","W1994277369","W1994307831","W1994341534","W1994646188","W1994898034","W1996371941","W1996711637","W1996926218","W1997558108","W1997928928","W2000442546","W2002019773","W2004103849","W2005431696","W2008843150","W2010418295","W2010469723","W2011059504","W2012250213","W2012413208","W2012688065","W2013255694","W2014727734","W2015113283","W2015712245","W2018096710","W202007523","W2020580424","W2022971084","W2023133292","W2023153884","W2026178764","W2026203813","W2027586610","W2028748639","W2029045893","W2029616555","W2030346622","W2030956076","W2031385454","W2033680038","W2034401866","W2034680167","W2034956222","W2035314238","W2035664125","W2035944324","W2040823963","W2041221488","W2042355753","W2046566071","W2047330557","W2047562441","W2047695281","W2047892569","W2048498287","W2049615737","W2051556928","W2051621934","W2053586899","W2054099532","W2054190773","W2054215964","W2054272017","W2054884879","W2056366475","W2058119311","W2058359571","W2058584770","W2059581239","W2060091110","W2062025845","W2062310951","W2064296154","W2065121218","W2065854665","W2066657681","W2068548108","W2069201623","W2070426225","W2071887399","W2072134027","W2072995417","W2073271847","W2074408178","W2078059892","W2078757204","W2079382273","W2079603439","W2081360302","W2082320537","W2082940982","W2084917404","W2087086370","W2087678412","W2088323328","W2088438184","W2088783942","W2089953373","W2090061778","W2090775647","W2091601213","W2091905553","W2093752945","W2095430933","W2095734644","W2095805913","W2096656874","W2097110957","W2097885825","W2101592976","W2102326175","W2102696978","W2103114237","W2105662053","W2106876877","W2106952837","W2108425422","W2109229748","W2109322415","W2111416401","W2112279824","W2112689400","W2113241235","W2116938510","W2117866908","W2119012457","W2120515884","W2126550276","W2127750126","W2128553376","W2128655828","W2129573808","W2129829737","W2133721259","W2134338262","W2136284733","W2136334329","W2136575584","W2137179575","W2139000771","W2140091946","W2142155920","W2142947341","W2145513209","W2146715499","W2147928436","W2150798407","W2151479308","W2153149839","W2154867318","W2155997060","W2156148295","W2157954662","W2158304798","W2158454384","W2163139471","W2163848238","W2164693855","W2168226052","W2169416641","W2171306475","W2186309928","W2190766710","W220112480","W2233300032","W2313576834","W2314510470","W2314790286","W2317791064","W2319983832","W2320350515","W2323008516","W2325901017","W2327648646","W2329300391","W2332159918","W2333565005","W2338278742","W2384132444","W2399975345","W2413895194","W2423028615","W2518783293","W2528466831","W2616141209","W2738227539","W3006641047","W4214559180","W4236631466","W4239527626","W4241275127","W4242605405","W4245143020","W4250030511","W4251994223","W4296976415","W4297063083","W77078003","W80788041","W8747624"],"referencesCount":248,"citationsCount":29,"abstract":"Abstract: Low back pain has long been described as a challenge for both primary care physicians and specialists. Management of low back pain has also been criticized as frequently arbitrary, inappropriate, or ineffective. Contributing factors have been an inadequate evidence base and a need for more rigorous appraisals of the available literature. Evidence‐based medicine, an approach to clinical problem solving, is predicated on the premise that high‐quality health care will result from practices consistent with the best evidence. In contrast to the traditional medical paradigm that placed a heavy reliance on expert opinion, authority, and unsystematic clinical observations, evidence‐based medicine emphasizes the need for rigorous critical appraisals of the scientific literature to inform medical decision making. Evidence‐based medicine places strong weight on the requirement for valid studies, particularly randomized controlled trials, to appropriately evaluate the effectiveness of health care interventions. Because of the rapidly increasing volume of medical literature, however, most clinicians are unable to keep up‐to‐date with all the new data. Two types of preprocessed evidence that can aid busy clinicians in medical decision making are systematic reviews and evidence‐based clinical practice guidelines. Like primary studies, systematic reviews and clinical practice guidelines must adhere to high methodologic standards to reduce error and bias. As in other areas of medicine, the approach to the management of low back pain has been positively affected by the availability of more clinical trials and better use of critical appraisal techniques to evaluate and apply research findings. In addition to more rigorous primary studies, an increasing number of high‐quality systematic reviews and evidence‐based clinical practice guidelines for low back pain are also available. Although some research gaps and methodologic shortcomings persist, the richer evidence base has greatly improved our understanding of what does and does not work for low back pain. Despite these advances, the best available evidence often does not inform everyday clinical decisions for low back pain. Nonetheless, there is widespread agreement that adherence to evidence‐based practice will help improve low back pain patient outcomes and reduce arbitrary variations in care. This article reviews basic principles of evidence‐based medicine, discusses evidence‐based medicine in the context of low back pain management, and summarizes some useful evidence‐based medicine resources.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2102470393","numberInSourceReferences":1,"doi":"10.1111/J.1365-2362.2007.01794.X","type":"article","title":"Molecular evidence‐based medicine","authors":[{"id":"A5070446713","LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

Despite following largely parallel routes to date, the goals and principles of evidence‐based and molecular medicine are complementary and they should be converging. I define molecular evidence‐based medicine as the study of medical information that makes sense of the advances of molecular biological disciplines and where errors and biases are properly appreciated and placed in context. Biomedical measurement capacity improves very rapidly. The exponentially growing mass of hypotheses being tested requires a new approach to both statistical and biological inference. Multidimensional biology requires careful exact replication of research findings, but indirect corroboration is often all that is achieved at best. Besides random error, bias remains a major threat. It is often difficult to separate bias from the spirit of scientific inquiry to force data into coherent and ‘significant’ biological stories. Transparency and public availability of protocols, data, analyses and results may be crucial to make sense of the complex biology of human disease and avoid being flooded by spurious research findings. Research efforts should be integrated across teams in an open, sharing environment. Most research in the future may be designed, performed, and integrated in the public

Unfortunately, most physicians misunderstand the underlying probabilistic logic of significance tests and consequently often misinterpret their results. This near-universal misunderstanding is highlighted by means of a simple quiz which we administered to 246 physicians at two major academic hospitals, on which the proportion of incorrect responses exceeded 90%. A solid understanding of the fundamental concepts of probability theory is becoming essential to the rational interpretation of medical information. This essay provides a technically sound review of these concepts that is accessible to a medical audience. We also briefly review the debate in the cognitive sciences regarding physicians' aptitude for probabilistic

global incidence of allergic reaction has been rising for years, especially within westernised urban areas. There is evidence that the interaction between pollen grains, environmental pollution and meteorological change is increasing the allergenicity of the pollen grain and consequently, increasing the misery of hay fever sufferers. Laboratory experiments have shown that the interaction of pollen with atmospheric oxidants such as ozone and nitrogen dioxide (\\(NO_2\\)) can alter protein molecules that are present within the pollen grains via post-translational modification of the protein. \r\n\r\nWithin the laboratory, birch pollen was exposed to atmospherically relevant exposures of gas phase \\(NO_2\\) and ozone under a range of environmentally relevant conditions (temperature and relative humidity RH). The effects of the exposures on the biochemistry of the pollen grains were probed using proteomic approach. The morphological changes of unexposed and exposed pollen samples to RH, rainwater and \\(NO_2\\), where observed under fluorescence microscopy and scanning electron microscope. The discoveries suggest that interaction between gas pollutants and pollen do exist and cause protein specific modifications; nitration. \r\n\r\nDetailed analysis of London Ambulance data compared to London temperature data is presented. The relationships established will allow for prediction of likely changes in ambulance demand (and illness types) that will be caused by seasonal temperature changes, increased frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, due to climate change, in the future. \r\n\r\nThe study applied statistical analyses to examine short-term associations between birch pollen count with allergic related illnesses recorded in the London Ambulance data, temperature and \\(NO_2\\).","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2243629635","numberInSourceReferences":4,"doi":"10.1080/09332480.2019.1579573","type":"article","title":"Why Most Published Research Findings Are False","authors":[{"id":"A5070446713","LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

La probabilité qu’un résultat publié soit vrai peut dépendre de la puissance de l’étude et d’éventuels biais ; du nombre d’autres études sur le même sujet ; et, de manière cruciale, du taux de résultats positifs par rapport à celui de résultats nuls parmi les rapports étudiés par chaque domaine scientifique. Des simulations sont effectuées pour évaluer la probabilité qu’un résultat publié soit faux. Dans ce contexte, un résultat a une moindre probabilité de véracité quand le nombre d’études similaires effectuées dans un domaine donné est petit ; quand les tailles d’effet sont plus petites ; quand le nombre de relations étudiées est plus important et leur présélection plus petite ; quand il y a une plus grande flexibilité dans le protocole, les définitions, les mesures et la modalité d’analyse ; quand il y a un plus grand intérêt financier (avec le biais qui peut l’accompagner) ; et quand plusieurs équipes dans un domaine sont engagées dans une course aux résultats qui soient statistiquement significatifs. Pour de nombreux champs de recherche actuels, des résultats publiés ne sont ni plus ni moins qu’un reflet fidèle des biais régnants. Dans cet essai, j’explore les implications de ces problèmes par rapport à la conduite et l’interprétation de la recherche.

oxygen-18 content of precipitation in the Amazon basin is characterized by a very small inland gradient, 0.75 × 10−3 ‰ km−1. This is a consequence of the large contribution of reevaporated moisture to the basin's water balance. A distinct seasonal and regional pattern of stable isotope composition has been recognized and shows the basin to be inhomogeneous from the hydrometeorological point of view. The occasional appearance of very low δ values is believed to be related to the position of the ITCZ rather than to interbasin

Abstract Biodiversity, a central component of Earth's life support systems, is directly relevant to human societies. We examine the dimensions and nature of the Earth's terrestrial biodiversity and review the scientific facts concerning the rate of loss of biodiversity and the drivers of this loss. The estimate for the total number of species of eukaryotic organisms possible lies in the 5–15 million range, with a best guess of ∼7 million. Species diversity is unevenly distributed; the highest concentrations are in tropical ecosystems. Endemisms are concentrated in a few hotspots, which are in turn seriously threatened by habitat destruction—the most prominent driver of biodiversity loss. For the past 300 years, recorded extinctions for a few groups of organisms reveal rates of extinction at least several hundred times the rate expected on the basis of the geological record. The loss of biodiversity is the only truly irreversible global environmental change the Earth faces today.","tldr":"The dimensions and nature of the Earth's terrestrial biodiversity are examined, and the scientific facts concerning the rate of loss of biodiversity and the drivers of this loss are reviewed."},{"id":"7411530aa26843b62f9174fa9d004bab72e476dc","numberInSourceReferences":49,"doi":"10.1029/2002JD002670","type":null,"title":"Global analyses of sea surface temperature, sea ice, and night marine air temperature since the late nineteenth century","authors":[{"id":"40333590","LN":"Rayner","FN":"N."},{"id":"48230829","LN":"Parker","FN":"D."},{"id":"103221489","LN":"Horton","FN":"E.

HadISST1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (GISST) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of SST and sea ice concentration on a 1° latitude-longitude grid from 1871. The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5° latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration. HadISST1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional SST well, containing SST fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in GISST. HadMAT1 is more consistent with SST and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous NMAT data sets."},{"id":"70fae121f412c19612115eff06c13134b8cb2060","numberInSourceReferences":26,"doi":"10.1029/2004GL020972","type":null,"title":"Detection of climate system bifurcations by degenerate fingerprinting","authors":[{"id":"145735157","LN":"Held","FN":"H."},{"id":"13664304","LN":"Kleinen","FN":"T."}],"year":2004,"date":"2004-12-16","journal":"Geophysical Research Letters","volume":"31","references":["279888a4729cf2910aa5c048ea8704d8cb95e0e8","594fa59342e28e6f627123a2f56faf794f359bd4","7be1503a792568ba35e9ba65a6a98876dc2bc808","fd794aac5f2592fde6146aa2c8618fba7e38754f","d27b49310ec37048e93c6a85a23e9c285ce8ae3c","cad4d2282c84628b810c5a99258c4a60b641744e","16fa67e37d9c114f63a01345286bfff3d4878e11","9ff0d8cc7fdc9b3f0440100e308adfa6e7096c9e","9a4c0aacbc4f87c7de54d185b70b0d7d1c64356f","8d6c456151ae3a59909406e223e76b372e92d9d9","82400aa057e200cc72ee9ed9021dce4c5e464cca","02da68e9ceddef6fe9e1a7042229609bca635b82","bdb15624d725cc38f2dd8c73dd6e01b4ca13316e","247ea97aa51b4ecc11f9fa0bdc62680470add857","661903691f83b293b7175be8f62a947006964131","fb0f84092776169eb2afde1c08c884b7100f14b2",null,null,null],"referencesCount":19,"citationsCount":247,"abstract":"A method is introduced to estimate the proximity of climate sub‐systems to non‐linear thresholds.

It is shown that proper analysis of paleo information could significantly reduce the uncertainty which plagues current estimates of the distance from the shutdown of the thermohaline circulation."},{"id":"37a09c5884e85fb6481e8bbd06724fa5ab293a39","numberInSourceReferences":10,"doi":"10.1038/NATURE06960","type":["JournalArticle"],"title":"Increasing risk of Amazonian drought due to decreasing aerosol pollution","authors":[{"id":"48372668","LN":"Cox","FN":"P."},{"id":"29845971","LN":"Harris","FN":"P."},{"id":"39624270","LN":"Huntingford","FN":"C."},{"id":"32411931","LN":"Betts","FN":"R."},{"id":"144426391","LN":"Collins","FN":"M."},{"id":"39448670","LN":"Jones","FN":"C."},{"id":"6216381","LN":"Jupp","FN":"T."},{"id":"2473622","LN":"Marengo","FN":"J."},{"id":"48778877","LN":"Nobre","FN":"C."}],"year":2008,"date":"2008-05-08","journal":"Nature","volume":"453","firstPage":"212","lastPage":"215","references":["1b4d9ee96d24041e896dc9e66aa5efab5bcffa35","4289108f3c3eea60c64b38d3ffaf3cf3ec5097a7","3f150810eff352fda0f59671bcc75b3f70db759c","987fc140593dfa3e3990b0702be40f706989eed4","e7a6b0a06645d9f66f46300ddcb7415e22d445e6","609cd0bc2351ddb76777332c95db3ef8a2b04f3a","605b343e708fec10c0172696b393236b3882f6ae","4d322876371e3d284b9fa663f205c0dcbb98d5c7","a637f09be32f8ff15cf16b60321aaa74cb208ac1","7411530aa26843b62f9174fa9d004bab72e476dc","4b50133d32e861d43a20df41c42d13a86a8e6845","90f7bdbd989d77ab2813895f65357aa7f717aeb9","d8d9df30536e6309bb27721c78c99cd3f5b92491","4089b49dfc4eccea01bd85f7ce32acb9e456de05","4d1b4b37e042609799eb31e15e35ca52d021a9df","ff77d554e4174900682f17e13834b1a56052fb81","f4c3d185ae0b0ed44765b2c8582671bc49c5db60","b1ab3f8630920ccaa9ad0ad74df3c7511daea4c3","6dfcb2e9c8a609fb7edadedc63e950ce503c7bf3","fedd542a6c24f5dc2fc3b5cf8391326a605ccf85","d262075b7e6132be1eb220e5aca6104fa52cd869","0f43146e8240f1204a7f1884311c17236d331d6b","de21e86593d886ca629fd9a232a8a26cba75ed8b","7dedeb1d928ff8c4e6d0d9fccee1abc431bb528d","38ac8621e56003d0c91ecf4e3d24f403f28d5a9d","da915da6d90dcda4b6d2cd882f61af0a37aa2551","70e24a2b7387c2029c78c92f7267ff49712c41a8","0693611f67136513e2737db2c9421649143b832c","92e2b79d56fe1212902f34d8125542e56f602311","ed5d20511f9087309f91fcd6504960baf101bce3","7dda8c5ee7154fbcf2c7a4bb31ce1d9c9feca347",null,null,"b214624cfd3764c091804c73ed213d4f85f03cba",null,"4d619b602c109930fccec728c2ad11b5da84c062",null,null,null],"referencesCount":39,"citationsCount":391,"abstract":null,"tldr":"Simulations for the twenty-first century using the same model show a strong tendency for the SST conditions associated with the 2005 drought to become much more common, owing to continuing reductions in reflective aerosol pollution in the Northern Hemisphere."},{"id":"4d41108590a7823ea9b943bd4c614534edba3b8d","numberInSourceReferences":25,"doi":"10.1073/PNAS.0802430105","type":["JournalArticle"],"title":"Slowing down as an early warning signal for abrupt climate change","authors":[{"id":"49546110","LN":"Dakos","FN":"V."},{"id":"145644167","LN":"Scheffer","FN":"M."},{"id":"7606675","LN":"Nes","FN":"E.

One explanation for such events of abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future. Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and show that they were all preceded by a characteristic slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply independent empirical evidence for the idea that past abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change. Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this is a promising perspective.","tldr":"This work analyzes eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and shows that they were all preceded by a characteristic slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the actual shift, implying independent empirical evidence for the idea that past abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical thresholds."},{"id":"706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","numberInSourceReferences":3,"doi":"10.1126/SCIENCE.1146961","type":["Review","JournalArticle"],"title":"Climate Change, Deforestation, and the Fate of the Amazon","authors":[{"id":"48401102","LN":"Malhi","FN":"Y."},{"id":"48401102","LN":"Malhi","FN":"Y."},{"id":"152300833","LN":"Roberts","FN":"J."},{"id":"32411931","LN":"Betts","FN":"R."},{"id":"117212348","LN":"Killeen","FN":"T."},{"id":"2108769467","LN":"Li","FN":"Wenhong"},{"id":"48778877","LN":"Nobre","FN":"C."}],"year":2008,"date":"2008-01-11","journal":"Science","volume":"319","firstPage":"169","lastPage":"172","references":["35688d70a82748021b15bf97a4cebad5e52b57b5","e3b85621274dad81a33ec4b7d07e3ba1857597dc","d36feb2e0f610c825e01b1ef2eef187bc61352b3","c7348503354071f9ac4d76a922c15bee391431fd","ce2f70fabf3495fa0d661b662c730a971472cc4d","a6dba705b97fa5345374bd275ca5b08498f174f1","2f78828a333f2c2ba7f5c793ce26f380d5fc89fa","f2732801f7cbbbf588705f10c12be24605830dee","4ff8ce4e0c661ea89e0107d81083b6e90841571f","e386aec723b58437195bad9486d2d6a959fe2a8c","fee78ff685c88c2211e19e82b5f7c124f7bc959d","8a331f5a3e5ee466fd8920ab57f3b08f67cf2843","995d5441acd26da84ce4aa6864876e17d9762c73","a8ee4ef420c2c6a90ee221bcb74b1663e111675c","609cd0bc2351ddb76777332c95db3ef8a2b04f3a","91887a0bf5788a99ac5a7cf130bcf60cf8e79c75","fb789046671b2615d7c2d5a4e41d9a55c66cfd5b","b6178a5917c3d05f7eb15304528960efc83b13e5","dd1bb4e85133c9a51149d1a5d10bb6ff2e595b9b","24ad0ab663766a08ee9001b58d725b2af5d3862a","35d2b9da90cde935dcf1ace9b4e12b33ce889279","29e0b01bab1c7cea2a91f55ff0624162654ef127","53919d771d66d723a5eeacf39a655206ab92d86a","4d322876371e3d284b9fa663f205c0dcbb98d5c7","9119754545a6deab1580bc67c56d38e05b32575e","090256bdc67eace0034cdc673595803cede39617","6f7c1306ab69379df6df8214bf5d140af053df7e","db5c2c422cb1f5fc9ccdc4c01b79904149288f50","d7b66a1f1c7181e2474062552d79cabfa9f0646f","34af8278b0a32fb2f5b3889c0e1213cff11e5c84","b9bfa59b4e92d76d84a5041438427663f87e2b1c","614f0a07eab4d3240918acda9ca6180b58e89b19","2b0dd59254ed9d1255f817e427ede2c9f53e5e5f","5ce44e4dce04761cd512f79242511b977a1b9a52","a2ffe92732622c4a7321dade663b03f0dc0d998c","4d26fcdc12504863140e64c149e3b9caa61cd303","6fcaeb14809751eeaa8ab071b2651efeb2b52004","c925b0563a7220f9d16ac85d66c1bd8ca335ca0b","ca3896c4318f728e2872f84fe70e97cfdb68481d","459ee19c9e39df89c7b5e3c34f9a67198d05de17","de0ac973dfb9dde93b4631642094347cfd632491","0707bb3c3139e9d3ddc1e9cb37aeb19436c76ed1","fbfb5fb4646201931a819cb96a7b7971a45de5ca","2fbcdd66c7ddcc5ca9ee04aeead8efe98eb3ad0e","a4a3c78685d591735decf34d0eb10a83d0208235","4ffd7867723c4b8de7ca25bd06906e8142c87296","95bc406687c3da6ebecc31a1710eb1207ea75b3d","8c403a4d7691dfffc5d55649ebd309dc1171efad",null,"acea7ea50129a20cd2afcc6ab96e1dc40d4addc6","17377fa1f57f01817679851cc8a1f613a00b3b99",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,"6f399b82412689b9a0adeadd41d4da507343a174",null,"89169870d9cf9d55ddbd060884f7a96fff366382"],"referencesCount":71,"citationsCount":1629,"abstract":"The forest biome of Amazonia is one of Earth's greatest biological treasures and a major component of the Earth system.

study tests the ability of five Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), forced with observed climatology and atmospheric CO2, to model the contemporary global carbon cycle. The DGVMs are also coupled to a fast ‘climate analogue model’, based on the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model (GCM), and run into the future for four Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES): A1FI, A2, B1, B2. Results show that all DGVMs are consistent with the contemporary global land carbon budget. Under the more extreme projections of future environmental change, the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. In particular, large uncertainties are associated with the response of tropical vegetation to drought and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. The DGVMs show more divergence in their response to regional changes in climate than to increases in atmospheric CO2 content. All models simulate a release of land carbon in response to climate, when physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant production are not considered, implying a positive terrestrial climate‐carbon cycle feedback. All DGVMs simulate a reduction in global net primary production (NPP) and a decrease in soil residence time in the tropics and extra‐tropics in response to future climate. When both counteracting effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem function are considered, all the DGVMs simulate cumulative net land carbon uptake over the 21st century for the four SRES emission scenarios. However, for the most extreme A1FI emissions scenario, three out of five DGVMs simulate an annual net source of CO2 from the land to the atmosphere in the final decades of the 21st century. For this scenario, cumulative land uptake differs by 494 Pg C among DGVMs over the 21st century. This uncertainty is equivalent to over 50 years of anthropogenic emissions at current levels."},{"id":"389ec712b590cba24a184aa9704bcfad0970f1b0","numberInSourceReferences":1,"doi":"10.1073/PNAS.0705414105","type":["JournalArticle"],"title":"Tipping elements in the Earth's climate

regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning indicators of impending shifts. A critical question, however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or shoreline development (only gradual restoration is possible). The model represents key features of a broad class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers can only be manipulated gradually management action is needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated, often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is also dependent on developing policy processes that enable society to respond more rapidly to information about impending regime shifts.","tldr":"To improve usefulness in averting ecological regime shifts, research is suggested to focus on defining critical indicator levels rather than detecting change in the indicators, and a new spectral density ratio indicator is presented."},{"id":"c5e8862bfd224b8078a77655602c910963df75d3","numberInSourceReferences":23,"doi":"10.1038/NATURE08227","type":["Review","JournalArticle"],"title":"Early-warning signals for critical transitions","authors":[{"id":"145644167","LN":"Scheffer","FN":"M."},{"id":"3001050","LN":"Bascompte","FN":"J."},{"id":"48680294","LN":"Brock","FN":"W."},{"id":"4262118","LN":"Brovkin","FN":"V."},{"id":"35280006","LN":"Carpenter","FN":"S."},{"id":"49546110","LN":"Dakos","FN":"V."},{"id":"145735157","LN":"Held","FN":"H."},{"id":"1708791","LN":"Nes","FN":"E.

test for two critical phenomena in Amazonian ecosystems: self-organized criticality (SOC) and critical transitions. SOC is often presented in the complex systems literature as a general explanation for scale invariance in nature. In particular, this mechanism is claimed to underlie the macroscopic structure and dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems. These would be inextricably linked to the action of fire, which is conceived as an endogenous ecological process. We show that Amazonian savanna fires display the scale-invariant features characteristic of SOC but do not display SOC. The same is true in Amazonian rainforests subject to moderate drought. These findings prove that there are other causes of scale invariance in ecosystems. In contrast, we do find evidence of a critical transition to a megafire regime under extreme drought in rainforests; this phenomenon is likely to determine the time scale of a possible loss of Amazonian rainforest caused by climate change.","tldr":"It is shown that Amazonian savanna fires display the scale-invariant features characteristic of SOC but do not display SOC; the same is true in Amazonian rainforests subject to moderate drought, proving that there are other causes of scale invariance in ecosystems."},{"id":"045555ec4342da07074949f540bc615cb8c453cf","numberInSourceReferences":20,"doi":"10.1111/J.1365-2486.2009.02157.X","type":null,"title":"Robust dynamics of Amazon dieback to climate change with perturbed ecosystem model parameters","authors":[{"id":"144853616","LN":"Poulter","FN":"B."},{"id":"3079572","LN":"Hattermann","FN":"F."},{"id":"143824624","LN":"Hawkins","FN":"E."},{"id":"4640770","LN":"Zaehle","FN":"S."},{"id":"3728155","LN":"Sitch","FN":"S."},{"id":"1397966798","LN":"Restrepo-Coupe","FN":"N."},{"id":"4672143","LN":"Heyder","FN":"U."},{"id":"143793523","LN":"Cramer","FN":"W."}],"year":2010,"date":"2010-09-01","journal":"Global Change Biology","volume":"16","references":["8465d01c40d89688d58d66cac6c2b8baeb1ee8d4","35688d70a82748021b15bf97a4cebad5e52b57b5","4ee0ec1e47aa74424a0a090f73b8603d776cb6ce","4b045f206ddd27d9d897dff2417d94f479cdbdc7","347bd795ab6024c13cfb2dacd82341b1788840c5","9271c3265160ab387ee1b785e7f0575084607df9","964105343f08d1ca48f7b76bd7cb0cdcd24a4c8b","bbfe41796d0a539fa80489da1c65bb394cb5bb58","c3d018f16596a73dbd602fd16d7f8f99b44a710a","c4d5519127c5930e0f7053b8341ff3afa2ddcd9c","d73b91f82033fed0d6d61d2d3abf145565b017b9","3d3aa810f4f13158d101ed10ed02a7e7ff186346","2e3a44d4e91d94797a526410379e29a177127603","a304c8034f76bcda00e2c0c28ec6aada01806414","df6ade47d3bbab757e8fcf6b3f026b7d3d44ed01","f0425e2b8925f3f963eccfe680d8e6e02c28d7f0","31693c9b7960774808dc32ff6a825d264b2dd34f","37a09c5884e85fb6481e8bbd06724fa5ab293a39","8c28cbee2aa9d9dba2d797ff66a4ef4419156b5d","80409f2342be237a797ac94d5095efa57a55ec42","ad291bd5b21860267afd7c5a1fc6d44148de71cf","2eed542cfb60b30f4fe0dbfa54b573398ba6993e","d7b4a30c881f74acf8eae8cf4ccc79ef5d0437a3","389ec712b590cba24a184aa9704bcfad0970f1b0","706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","da3b009864e1f75e882f3713a50e0de7bd977aa9","b2edf6e752a7c03fc1f32d90ea815697731642f2","416bdcb7d9fd89cefbd21104b79fbbc3b2a3c952","6e5026789b675868e14458a152834103737342b1","a6dba705b97fa5345374bd275ca5b08498f174f1","85040ca11dc73b2e50298b806c3ab448fce2e240","9e1512abe3bcb2e809b202ee534c6c86d80b9a93","c3bed1eb3ea064ce7b86c13dca3da9693aa0df09","db0806b45f61283547d1be7cf73fb4cbba764e2d","1d9620cd0a4f6d2d6b281616ba284f7f20995346","8d86b24e8fd2151153cff5fc0c2629e115d0827c","cff6223287063a1e6e117d3017e19ed18eb404c2","85859541f542a9526e3b4579683f4090388be102","fee78ff685c88c2211e19e82b5f7c124f7bc959d","8a331f5a3e5ee466fd8920ab57f3b08f67cf2843","294eb8df4c7a823a53ee958993c2d4f212641286","609cd0bc2351ddb76777332c95db3ef8a2b04f3a","827670fe8913af39c760bd9db97d997a2421b100","adbe47497d0497dd17c32ae0a02b58b56bc01758","53919d771d66d723a5eeacf39a655206ab92d86a","4590638a9e1bda868a5e90b09723ee9a4413cd31","a637f09be32f8ff15cf16b60321aaa74cb208ac1","01862860d6509d1de143fc0b82a460af97a035ab","dd53fbeb0d4943d4a7a72bedc20d2494dc67fafc","453dd174d548599f058efface4502458d8f8c977","fe4ae2bd0cf62ece4b265e4d09fea56c3c6b3aa5","eb6fe72a49d384ccddce7a3aa992573975981fe7","cf9f2a48528e50a5625eb8b8200d86a93e098b7a","230e42b7c7cb06e765ea3d8093b06b89fa1af6df","b23d41a477872dfa02d54e86d50b64a00c9969fd","bf1d0f059695e2f81df488f9e85844cca44590b6","d4aecdf02cb2112ced49e8d32ee507cde3636021","64921b0721e6f8bf82174d8df17c6db1bb7cd7fb","9fa9efe6479eb0fa6ccac1e772af9c797bc19f5b","7e0be2938e25d52eeb47c43584e1fecfcc0efe51","4001e6bfd58d23d0311c23db59bdfa2ce5ca05d2","1f0fdc714e51ada17239a001998d45e9fd3e4f46","cd61873f989916adf4017dc1e28f9c3107264784","fdf08ada775a8d3346d85fe9efc891b8e0cdf643","e2b05f861b12a32c0c27f82242c5c45f5e48026d","70ed39dcc39d95002b565bedd06c967f6d1b30a9","e74d3b4372a3033c2411f4ecf47012632a74b9d1","4eb3b8dfbd20430a36b0dc872fd8455d4c16f091","fefb31334eafeb347441412de022aae02bc7e373","3b762329e20d8ba55b484dcbe30985548ccb5bdf","ae5279bb27111a348c59a80d3da8dc1138363973","17377fa1f57f01817679851cc8a1f613a00b3b99",null,"94d29faa7196dcf92ab6189a8f583480fa30c3be",null,null,null,"ff7096ee70941afcad1cbd0dfc4f7e8efa4c3847","b4229024752e2bcfde34e98c96fea7b28dcc877c",null,null,"cccd81a7ef040f69f8d7520a92cab9a2a6d10d9d","fa92432314cd0fbb3707e0ebf24d820176df3510"],"referencesCount":83,"citationsCount":69,"abstract":"Climate change science is increasingly concerned with methods for managing and integrating sources of uncertainty from emission storylines, climate model projections, and ecosystem model parameterizations. In tropical ecosystems, regional climate projections and modeled ecosystem responses vary greatly, leading to a significant source of uncertainty in global biogeochemical accounting and possible future climate feedbacks. Here, we combine an ensemble of IPCC‐AR4 climate change projections for the Amazon Basin (eight general circulation models) with alternative ecosystem parameter sets for the dynamic global vegetation model, LPJmL. We evaluate LPJmL simulations of carbon stocks and fluxes against flux tower and aboveground biomass datasets for individual sites and the entire basin. Variability in LPJmL model sensitivity to future climate change is primarily related to light and water limitations through biochemical and water‐balance‐related parameters. Temperature‐dependent parameters related to plant respiration and photosynthesis appear to be less important than vegetation dynamics (and their parameters) for determining the magnitude of ecosystem response to climate change. Variance partitioning approaches reveal that relationships between uncertainty from ecosystem dynamics and climate projections are dependent on geographic location and the targeted ecosystem process. Parameter uncertainty from the LPJmL model does not affect the trajectory of ecosystem response for a given climate change scenario and the primary source of uncertainty for Amazon ‘dieback’ results from the uncertainty among climate projections. Our approach for describing uncertainty is applicable for informing and prioritizing policy options related to mitigation and adaptation where long‐term investments are required."},{"id":"a010b76e1a809da5a128def075a310b1b1511593","numberInSourceReferences":46,"doi":"10.1126/SCIENCE.1200807","type":["JournalArticle"],"title":"The 2010 Amazon Drought","authors":[{"id":"3890299","LN":"Lewis","FN":"S."},{"id":"7322794","LN":"Brando","FN":"P."},{"id":"31946163","LN":"Phillips","FN":"O."},{"id":"35353707","LN":"Heijden","FN":"G.

Recently, it has been proposed that such loss of resilience may be detected from elevated autocorrelation and variance in the fluctuations of the state of an ecosystem due to critical slowing down; the underlying generic phenomenon that occurs at critical thresholds. Here we explore the robustness of autocorrelation and variance as indicators of imminent critical transitions. We show both analytically and in simulations that variance may sometimes decrease close to a transition. This can happen when environmental factors fluctuate stochastically and the ecosystem becomes less sensitive to these factors near the threshold, or when critical slowing down reduces the ecosystem's capacity to follow high-frequency fluctuations in the environment. In addition, when available data is limited, variance can be systematically underestimated due to the prevalence of low frequencies close to a transition. By contrast, autocorrelation always increases toward critical transitions in our analyses. To exemplify this point, we provide cases of rising autocorrelation and increasing or decreasing variance in time series prior to past climate transitions.","tldr":"The robustness of autocorrelation

in Flux Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains. Landsat data reveals details of forest losses and gains across the globe on an annual basis from 2000 to 2012. Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms. These results depict a globally consistent and locally relevant record of forest change.","tldr":"Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally, and boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms."},{"id":"5595d6e87417ba69831cd6da96e063b0a7ea373b","numberInSourceReferences":42,"doi":"10.1073/PNAS.1302584110","type":["JournalArticle"],"title":"Increased dry-season length over southern Amazonia in recent decades and its implication for future climate projection","authors":[{"id":"144348225","LN":"Fu","FN":"R."},{"id":"46579964","LN":"Yin","FN":"L."},{"id":"2108769467","LN":"Li","FN":"Wenhong"},{"id":"32966428","LN":"Arias","FN":"P."},{"id":"7562455","LN":"Dickinson","FN":"R."},{"id":"2109138314","LN":"Huang","FN":"Lei"},{"id":"153395601","LN":"Chakraborty","FN":"S."},{"id":"36815464","LN":"Fernandes","FN":"K."},{"id":"6822106","LN":"Liebmann","FN":"B."},{"id":"49353300","LN":"Fisher","FN":"R."},{"id":"7543846","LN":"Myneni","FN":"R."}],"year":2013,"date":"2013-10-21","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"110","firstPage":"18110","lastPage":"18115","references":["bab6bc5b33dbbdd580f67e679683b0d328ec280b","426d997cfac9ea3959ab27e366d769eca901606a","c331d747d84ce490920400a352fa3eeecafc4a7f","48e20beab31430668cc14bceff2fb726d72ce2b8","22dd5901a668e7160d3a03c76e3d39dd430821de","7fa10285fd3532aea2e64d0d6de06608266b4366","c1f4d0ada1bc02630bf78d4808a9d867c98af370","878c531fc7889fb5b6b29733f8b74d186899cfc3","97e67208b41ec60e4f426ba8b599f16610ee058e","65a3f5f3f06eced6d8dae4dbc8d0a4dcea6548b5","acc59a30d83ff1a9b64e0ab38918baf635b1891d","ccb1091e8be50a72a2bab3076fdd3a6c6e2179c8","50963d76d9ba8b0e39cbe5616234a1cc87cae52e","201b76815c9efc63b534b3c20c23423b72b6ec4f","a010b76e1a809da5a128def075a310b1b1511593","06393e8e0d910d8109e56f9310438c63f4625694","7ec3510a523be21fe3d3f66306572c2202eeb76d","4ee0ec1e47aa74424a0a090f73b8603d776cb6ce","ad12c3c6a7c6057b24cd1145390d91678436ae22","8eae17d86e6366f535382447172dfdc2b2c97bc8","b10de42e76cf9e5c4fac71e94b87dd19d859c457","3cedb68c3a4c749a76f5cb982a669c716030eadb","2841e22aec66c5f665f4b4b8c69a1e7149a2bfa7","ce3716fc0361f5d4f9b9bdbfd801235d79e570b0","33c6c516c0a1b5bbc2b3b717560b382c4e4a3175","17d23b26fc56836ad292a208fd2a55c9d0f68d8b","a6dba705b97fa5345374bd275ca5b08498f174f1","dce2d1cd3316ba2288aacf11c0bf12bfdba25dc9","fc5430e69fde0676363051a50a550c212f4a7dbb","8a331f5a3e5ee466fd8920ab57f3b08f67cf2843","609cd0bc2351ddb76777332c95db3ef8a2b04f3a","4ad76e9e4d3e2e0985b8b26e1f5606f262ca103c","086b6041fdf108ddad98d3750930bf661ff7aa5a","8884e8ebcbca04d1950cd1cb25d50ad9304a5857","1d245bc06645e93b7209983bb5afea2cf2c22378","0451af3e636bf74400f8f394fc3ec9d3e69bb0df","3d0414dbe59319fde2f57563b462762d6434f5d1","a5a57a5760aea5ff03ba578e1f93b492ebedc0f6","2b0dd59254ed9d1255f817e427ede2c9f53e5e5f","f3666d7b160eca8cca099fa59fcfd902cba7a860","6dfcb2e9c8a609fb7edadedc63e950ce503c7bf3","fedd542a6c24f5dc2fc3b5cf8391326a605ccf85","46aca6dc34009401cc3afe723bed6d8ecea77274","6a15e58668576cd7e26d689bb682f7bb6c801797","f8a6c5720f38250695cebbca608c859bd64e9798","2fbcdd66c7ddcc5ca9ee04aeead8efe98eb3ad0e","3c8d659422dd8c8a8101556887b603ebc13746fe","d1700f180eeddb9bb47cba2c93fb641719951d12",null,"4097d1d38c786f89b895eb17daaf2de1d1a79b14","a366037a8f96449063cbd969e88295c78d539e25","afc68fc8effbffb30de0b6a4c29d2c802900e07b","67ea44e559e8e80886defb873fdab9b4f609b657","268fa058ba37fbb8de27d176d82c167d87855331",null,"73dba3954ee56d41fa19c112d8ca7b404a5b764f",null],"referencesCount":57,"citationsCount":411,"abstract":"Significance Whether the dry-season length will increase is a central question in determining the fate of the rainforests over Amazonia and the future global atmospheric CO2 concentration. We show observationally that the dry-season length over southern Amazonia has increased significantly since 1979. We do not know what has caused this change, although it resembles the effects of anthropogenic climate change. The global climate models that were presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fifth assessment report seem to substantially underestimate the variability of the dry-season length. Such a bias implies that the future change of the dry-season length, and hence the risk of rainforest die-back, may be underestimated by the projections of these models. We have observed that the dry-season length (DSL) has increased over southern Amazonia since 1979, primarily owing to a delay of its ending dates (dry-season end, DSE), and is accompanied by a prolonged fire season. A poleward shift of the subtropical jet over South America and an increase of local convective inhibition energy in austral winter (June–August) seem to cause the delay of the DSE in austral spring (September–November). These changes cannot be simply linked to the variability of the tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although they show some resemblance to the effects of anthropogenic forcings reported in the literature, we cannot attribute them to this cause because of inadequate representation of these processes in the global climate models that were presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report. These models significantly underestimate the variability of the DSE and DSL and their controlling processes. Such biases imply that the future change of the DSE and DSL may be underestimated by the climate projections provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report models. Although it is not clear whether the observed increase of the DSL will continue in the future, were it to continue at half the rate of that observed, the long DSL and fire season that contributed to the 2005 drought would become the new norm by the late 21st century. The large uncertainty shown in this study highlights the need for a focused effort to better understand and simulate these changes over southern Amazonia.","tldr":"It is observed that the dry-season length over southern Amazonia has increased significantly since 1979, primarily owing to a delay of its ending dates (dry-season end, DSE), and is accompanied by a prolonged fire season."},{"id":"922cd02a5e4f1298384cb5b9f6d13df5daf64b70","numberInSourceReferences":13,"doi":"10.1073/PNAS.1305499111","type":["JournalArticle"],"title":"Abrupt increases in Amazonian tree mortality due to drought–fire interactions","authors":[{"id":"7322794","LN":"Brando","FN":"P."},{"id":"4080363","LN":"Balch","FN":"J."},{"id":"4820713","LN":"Nepstad","FN":"D."},{"id":"3420619","LN":"Morton","FN":"D."},{"id":"3327762","LN":"Putz","FN":"F."},{"id":"3476221","LN":"Coe","FN":"M."},{"id":"47081671","LN":"Silvério","FN":"D."},{"id":"32817696","LN":"Macedo","FN":"M."},{"id":"35389495","LN":"Davidson","FN":"E."},{"id":"49700525","LN":"Nóbrega","FN":"C."},{"id":"2198420","LN":"Alencar","FN":"A."},{"id":"1398435774","LN":"Soares-Filho","FN":"B."}],"year":2014,"date":"2014-04-14","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"111","firstPage":"6347","lastPage":"6352","references":["33eccbbc91b0250cbdee3a1a1968a664f3f3d501","53b4f7148231d42f5d7981a6d38c4906dbc1a762","c5d1cae1051791b37d57974825c341269571ce99","6c03e2458f3b3df096be3c5e02ee3738cff0a48a","b40d16532ee3bf9af7b1fdc0a71ceef9d1f4a68e","963c95a977e4ce253791a7683ee19d91514a2002","7294b60bc88a5f9466954c1e6e1814d4126f2941","3a8bc533dab2c1f3ea0a9e82741731e6eacd0c00","52061e926e029749735d473170cbc68662fc230f","9116bf686fc01f5d84e5c11149f185921c44ef2a","d2d1c5b6db0a49162e26cbe3681aba5746dac515","1dc886ac2f208422112e7670647c99b5e22966ed","697b3c5a9a2e157e3fa325c040ebd16680e0ea00","878c531fc7889fb5b6b29733f8b74d186899cfc3","4ebfd135a10d3b0ddd32326964725f5283c65a96","c0b9411d70eeb4c0b08dc86695a54b5e69793be3","a010b76e1a809da5a128def075a310b1b1511593","67730bbb104cb56794e8d553355ea0139fe63ac6","9b9bc11496aacbb487d3e4a1de41cd97e40ce8b4","8c4d03a6bc3f7c1843c47abf0c25e9e5a33836ca","dc4d3fe84a37f1676508a2e4a6d141be3c3fd5f8","ceb32e4f47d1069857f6315d1fb42518d9cbaf42","55476098b14184ca188a8fa59119904d67cff209","37a09c5884e85fb6481e8bbd06724fa5ab293a39","d7b4a30c881f74acf8eae8cf4ccc79ef5d0437a3","11b818942de2195d08c429a281f882a15e80db49","2b783dbd5e66f6b5b49e03885202d78a8e26bd40","706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","2f78828a333f2c2ba7f5c793ce26f380d5fc89fa","49f21e7768ca6a31c6f29feac8c053562c02e5e0","b5bb50e56ddfc66f746a34a749a92a489d43d975","c409ab496b3a306a9e14c730c898d63a7ac171f2","74ec15f91fc2877baa5d488a86e90889389ab6c1","dbb4a92166ef11e25f929377d167f4f021040efd","f9fb9378cde985eb2b1236bfe26b1ffc3f760f3a","fedd542a6c24f5dc2fc3b5cf8391326a605ccf85","4a31feb8468936a9bb3246196bcff5a3bc2d0c99","e6bd9186e04dd9428235a08a497417c4731b2735","57f990c3ba70ab8fbb913a99a3f8d5b5460f62a6","1477343b06ca6f6583424b7e5fe0f252a91fcfce","91ead8e10e659cee272cb55b0f5cdd728149920d","6d623b96717cf9897e58f28601edab3deaa2b081","9c3737fabb853bb4b6452c34a5e032c28e18550e"],"referencesCount":43,"citationsCount":609,"abstract":"Significance Climate change alone is unlikely to drive severe tropical forest degradation in the next few decades, but an alternative process associated with severe weather and forest fires is already operating in southeastern Amazonia. Recent droughts caused greatly elevated fire-induced tree mortality in a fire experiment and widespread regional forest fires that burned 5–12% of southeastern Amazon forests. These results suggest that feedbacks between fires and extreme climatic conditions could increase the likelihood of an Amazon forest “dieback” in the near-term. To secure the integrity of seasonally dry Amazon forests, efforts to end deforestation must be accompanied by initiatives that reduce the accidental spread of land management fires into neighboring forest reserves and effectively suppress forest fires when they start. Interactions between climate and land-use change may drive widespread degradation of Amazonian forests. High-intensity fires associated with extreme weather events could accelerate this degradation by abruptly increasing tree mortality, but this process remains poorly understood. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first field-based evidence of a tipping point in Amazon forests due to altered fire regimes. Based on results of a large-scale, long-term experiment with annual and triennial burn regimes (B1yr and B3yr, respectively) in the Amazon, we found abrupt increases in fire-induced tree mortality (226 and 462%) during a severe drought event, when fuel loads and air temperatures were substantially higher and relative humidity was lower than long-term averages. This threshold mortality response had a cascading effect, causing sharp declines in canopy cover (23 and 31%) and aboveground live biomass (12 and 30%) and favoring widespread invasion by flammable grasses across the forest edge area (80 and 63%), where fires were most intense (e.g., 220 and 820 kW⋅m−1). During the droughts of 2007 and 2010, regional forest fires burned 12 and 5% of southeastern Amazon forests, respectively, compared with <1% in nondrought years. These results show that a few extreme drought events, coupled with forest fragmentation and anthropogenic ignition sources, are already causing widespread fire-induced tree mortality and forest degradation across southeastern Amazon forests. Future projections of vegetation responses to climate change across drier portions of the Amazon require more than simulation of global climate forcing alone and must also include interactions of extreme weather events, fire, and land-use change.","tldr":"The results show that a few extreme drought events, coupled with forest fragmentation and anthropogenic ignition sources, are already causing widespread fire-induced tree mortality and forest degradation across southeastern Amazon forests."},{"id":"6c69a425959a4e98df944c10300258f18119c3b7","numberInSourceReferences":56,"doi":"10.3334/ORNLDAAC/1284","type":null,"title":"LBA-ECO LC-07 Wetland Extent, Vegetation, and Inundation: Lowland Amazon Basin","authors":[{"id":"32103834","LN":"Hess","FN":"L."},{"id":"70428400","LN":"Melack","FN":"J."},{"id":"40090862","LN":"Affonso","FN":"Adriana G."},{"id":"21462127","LN":"Barbosa","FN":"C."},{"id":"1436373588","LN":"Gastil-Buhl","FN":"M."},{"id":"33312009","LN":"Novo","FN":"E."}],"year":2015,"date":"2015-09-15","journal":"","volume":"","references":[],"referencesCount":0,"citationsCount":28,"abstract":null},{"id":"9e2b5146d43268cde0a223c4ebafead8b63d7528","numberInSourceReferences":52,"doi":"10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0828.1","type":null,"title":"Early-Warning Signals for the Onsets of Greenland Interstadials and the Younger Dryas–Preboreal Transition","authors":[{"id":"41032146","LN":"Rypdal","FN":"M."}],"year":2015,"date":"2015-12-23","journal":"Journal of Climate","volume":"29","firstPage":"4047","lastPage":"4056","references":["5e08d5ef785ee6b6b8ed1784dde5c99323336c85","39f5ee58f4364c092bbc3064c1683901faa62dc0","83d404c8b508303b47aad52c158a00d988f5c42b","809c11a0d0eed7b8d4fb97418b8895bb1eb308d3","fc13db298f988ceceeb56738e821c003e72bbef1","b090dd10b0f218261172d7d0f6c1492e696e0016","4550ec4ae20cb7bd3bf3b647ac65a93da033d465","71e5bf5ae110faef15ff52b9e5a669d8ad344c9a","df7f417194f887f535752e1b5c2cb469eb1e0c89","6ef5f14bee23e150535bbc780b5ad0066ad7021d","d5a50c2c4a6345ba6b5a326303e01214f314d7fd","ca3d4de2462fd81e15e2e23ce8bf6e13ef8dc8fc","4c081113ddadbb316dfe654cfc0a330d25ff0722","244084b5eae9de5e31e30789647269ace4e13f71","4d41108590a7823ea9b943bd4c614534edba3b8d","cf7776ef39cffa0632b45e2872591e314a64243f","711e1bdc5237dd66dff531f7a006bf01d5171036","a7d1407f6262ebb6bd5a45f9e9aca38e6045ecd6","122da8d29ce3b7be8bd275ce07f76ae0f5881310","dea7e3cef4e4b661719f6d3ca277712c05693867","1eee0716723024ef7e99b702f1bb2dc1901a4e16","d93b7d89c8970fe6ab94bc391559ded2d559d3f5","f8de1da740a2e4edca5d7aa7d4f3876c21b55edb","4d8302b56f7839302750fb1dc81f730872a2790f","b04913d88286ed289b05129d98fa3930df2e88f5","e24d4555ac3743fa68b9032274778f10e3720bfa","2c455f0da2bd86a9b9ea432d1485049073d7c63d",null,"a0e55ee7863e47348a8cd9c9387fa6cb82d29478","e18a91369273412a56e27424da6f0547ea77c564","e5b99bfdc3d993767e39b4d60028dc4e358d1721",null],"referencesCount":32,"citationsCount":31,"abstract":"Source: Journal of Climate doi: 10.4236/am.2016.715143 \\n \\n© 2016 American Meteorological Society (AMS).

A drought of similar climatological magnitude occurred again in 2010; however, there has been no basin‐wide ground‐based evaluation of effects on vegetation. We examine to what extent the 2010 drought affected forest dynamics using ground‐based observations of mortality and growth from an extensive forest plot network. We find that during the 2010 drought interval, forests did not gain biomass (net change: −0.43 Mg ha−1, confidence interval (CI): −1.11, 0.19, n = 97), regardless of whether forests experienced precipitation deficit anomalies. This contrasted with a long‐term biomass sink during the baseline pre‐2010 drought period (1998 to pre‐2010) of 1.33 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (CI: 0.90, 1.74, p < 0.01). The resulting net impact of the 2010 drought (i.e., reversal of the baseline net sink) was −1.95 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (CI:−2.77, −1.18; p < 0.001). This net biomass impact was driven by an increase in biomass mortality (1.45 Mg ha−1 yr−1 CI: 0.66, 2.25, p < 0.001) and a decline in biomass productivity (−0.50 Mg ha−1 yr−1, CI:−0.78, −0.31; p < 0.001). Surprisingly, the magnitude of the losses through tree mortality was unrelated to estimated local precipitation anomalies and was independent of estimated local pre‐2010 drought history. Thus, there was no evidence that pre‐2010 droughts compounded the effects of the 2010 drought. We detected a systematic basin‐wide impact of the 2010 drought on tree growth rates across Amazonia, which was related to the strength of the moisture deficit. This impact differed from the drought event in 2005 which did not affect productivity. Based on these ground data, live biomass in trees and corresponding estimates of live biomass in lianas and roots, we estimate that intact forests in Amazonia were carbon neutral in 2010 (−0.07 Pg C yr−1 CI:−0.42, 0.23), consistent with results from an independent analysis of airborne estimates of land‐atmospheric fluxes during 2010. Relative to the long‐term mean, the 2010 drought resulted in a reduction in biomass carbon uptake of 1.1 Pg C, compared to 1.6 Pg C for the 2005 event."},{"id":"68e014afbe6940b43981f8a572e3d995a4a95240","numberInSourceReferences":47,"doi":"10.1038/S41598-017-05373-2","type":null,"title":"Unprecedented drought over tropical South America in 2016: significantly under-predicted by tropical SST","authors":[{"id":"48724119","LN":"Erfanian","FN":"A."},{"id":"144149560","LN":"Wang","FN":"Guiling"},{"id":"2094367657","LN":"Fomenko","FN":"Lori"}],"year":2017,"date":"2017-07-19","journal":"Scientific Reports","volume":"7","references":[],"referencesCount":0,"citationsCount":0,"abstract":null},{"id":"d3d718f3f0e4e6d91b3b13524b3e90496e76f841","numberInSourceReferences":17,"doi":"10.1111/GCB.13733","type":["JournalArticle"],"title":"Exploring uncertainty of Amazon dieback in a perturbed parameter Earth system ensemble","authors":[{"id":"3460476","LN":"Boulton","FN":"C."},{"id":"102586118","LN":"Booth","FN":"B."},{"id":"39592390","LN":"Good","FN":"P."}],"year":2017,"date":"2017-06-01","journal":"Global Change Biology","volume":"23","firstPage":"5032","lastPage":"5044","references":["e43256238dbfcf1fe37aac918a6d2d033e22d380","dc9130ff1174aa7e65738207a5c914d1134bc321","d92b1c238d95c10e64edec1271f9d0dec34f6d54","963c95a977e4ce253791a7683ee19d91514a2002","c331d747d84ce490920400a352fa3eeecafc4a7f","806436f2eafe8cdd0611f044f234e1323de32d70","cb323fef41ec0ddd2d3dd840ea0d738f9ba4717b","d5ceb141c709ab0d6d74e41fe93aa06099bbd9fe","697b3c5a9a2e157e3fa325c040ebd16680e0ea00","32ba576f5e4b180064fbe3b3b60f19f9e648f644","7df84105463e5281abde61dd261b9b719dfdc87b","9deb120ec5fac77500a8fa14994452a54fc0cefa","045555ec4342da07074949f540bc615cb8c453cf","3fca3988703b2c04935d806dd9ae4467c1bd39f9","8c4d03a6bc3f7c1843c47abf0c25e9e5a33836ca","6ac5c35d9dc9a6ee19ddda9653ef8ae30e25a3e3","4ee0ec1e47aa74424a0a090f73b8603d776cb6ce","4c081113ddadbb316dfe654cfc0a330d25ff0722","be3eda717b99731f93de80d75031f38e40f84cee","8eae17d86e6366f535382447172dfdc2b2c97bc8","df6ade47d3bbab757e8fcf6b3f026b7d3d44ed01","37a09c5884e85fb6481e8bbd06724fa5ab293a39","55c1671ac52af4c00f1aaa912777e5af0db10a3c","3f150810eff352fda0f59671bcc75b3f70db759c","4289108f3c3eea60c64b38d3ffaf3cf3ec5097a7","706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","bfe43d4fe923c399fac374999d8883d43ee1f207","55404bc3b0bc58a6cb92914a1b79fbb4bcb57839","a6dba705b97fa5345374bd275ca5b08498f174f1","79f5347aee431eaf7c1ca95405950a2a4ef19a41","4d6b87bd0033d22b035cce759edbc7ff70c36057","85859541f542a9526e3b4579683f4090388be102","f991a2a0e09f442a2ad528bbcab8fc0992f7cf3b","f197f9cc819cad21910df3f60d05ce90c57356b6","a637f09be32f8ff15cf16b60321aaa74cb208ac1","df2a97e41bd5ac8682cc0480a7b7256b2f9c5f00","2b0dd59254ed9d1255f817e427ede2c9f53e5e5f","fedd542a6c24f5dc2fc3b5cf8391326a605ccf85","87181b6a1e291e487e6e5de9bb8b005d15bcecaa","2865cb823da209c4396a4db48e4c65ec4b2cded7"],"referencesCount":40,"citationsCount":24,"abstract":"The future of the Amazon rainforest is unknown due to uncertainties in projected climate change and the response of the forest to this change (forest resiliency). Here, we explore the effect of some uncertainties in climate and land surface processes on the future of the forest, using a perturbed physics ensemble of HadCM3C. This is the first time Amazon forest changes are presented using an ensemble exploring both land vegetation processes and physical climate feedbacks in a fully coupled modelling framework. Under three different emissions scenarios, we measure the change in the forest coverage by the end of the 21st century (the transient response) and make a novel adaptation to a previously used method known as “dry‐season resilience” to predict the long‐term committed response of the forest, should the state of the climate remain constant past 2100. Our analysis of this ensemble suggests that there will be a high chance of greater forest loss on longer timescales than is realized by 2100, especially for mid‐range and low emissions scenarios. In both the transient and predicted committed responses, there is an increasing uncertainty in the outcome of the forest as the strength of the emissions scenarios increases. It is important to note however, that very few of the simulations produce future forest loss of the magnitude previously shown under the standard model configuration. We find that low optimum temperatures for photosynthesis and a high minimum leaf area index needed for the forest to compete for space appear to be precursors for dieback. We then decompose the uncertainty into that associated with future climate change and that associated with forest resiliency, finding that it is important to reduce the uncertainty in both of these if we are to better determine the Amazon's outcome.","tldr":"This is the first time Amazon forest changes are presented using an ensemble exploring both land vegetation processes and physical climate

of the planet's diversity is concentrated in the tropics, which includes many regions undergoing rapid climate change. Yet, while climate‐induced biodiversity changes are widely documented elsewhere, few studies have addressed this issue for lowland tropical ecosystems. Here we investigate whether the floristic and functional composition of intact lowland Amazonian forests have been changing by evaluating records from 106 long‐term inventory plots spanning 30 years. We analyse three traits that have been hypothesized to respond to different environmental drivers (increase in moisture stress and atmospheric CO2 concentrations): maximum tree size, biogeographic water‐deficit affiliation and wood density. Tree communities have become increasingly dominated by large‐statured taxa, but to date there has been no detectable change in mean wood density or water deficit affiliation at the community level, despite most forest plots having experienced an intensification of the dry season. However, among newly recruited trees, dry‐affiliated genera have become more abundant, while the mortality of wet‐affiliated genera has increased in those plots where the dry season has intensified most. Thus, a slow shift to a more dry‐affiliated Amazonia is underway, with changes in compositional dynamics (recruits and mortality) consistent with climate‐change drivers, but yet to significantly impact whole‐community composition. The Amazon observational record suggests that the increase in atmospheric CO2 is driving a shift within tree communities to large‐statured species and that climate changes to date will impact forest composition, but long generation times of tropical trees mean that biodiversity change is lagging behind climate change.","tldr":"A slow shift to a more dry‐affiliated Amazonia is underway, with

paper shows recent progress in our understanding of climate variability and trends in the Amazon region, and how these interact with land use change. The review includes an overview of up-to-date information on climate and hydrological variability, and on warming trends in Amazonia, which reached 0.6-0.7 °C over the last 40 years, with 2016 as the warmest year since at least 1950 (0.9 °C +0.3°C). We focus on local and remote drivers of climate variability and change. We review the impacts of these drivers on the length of dry season, the role of the forest in climate and carbon cycles, the resilience of the forest, the risk of fires and biomass burning, and the potential “die back” of the Amazon forests if surpassing a “tipping point”. The role of the Amazon in moisture recycling and transport is also investigated, and a review of model development for climate change projections in the region is included. In sum, future sustainability of the Amazonian forests and its many services requires management strategies that consider the likelihood of multi-year droughts superimposed on a continued warming trend. Science has assembled enough knowledge to underline the global and regional importance of an intact Amazon region that can support policymaking and to keep this sensitive ecosystem functioning. This major challenge requires substantial resources and strategic cross-national planning, and a unique blend of expertise and capacities established in Amazon countries and from international collaboration. This also highlights the role of deforestation control in in support of policy for mitigation options as established in the Paris Agreement of 2015."},{"id":"14a62330576422c5e984be619299206110bacefb","numberInSourceReferences":12,"doi":"10.1126/SCIADV.ABA2949","type":["Editorial"],"title":"Amazon tipping point: Last chance for action","authors":[{"id":"30184944","LN":"Lovejoy","FN":"T."},{"id":"48778877","LN":"Nobre","FN":"C."}],"year":2019,"date":"2019-12-01","journal":"Science Advances","volume":"5","references":["182f30101b0cd88b4bc1ba534cd22071e00bb894","ccb5d68fc4aef32b84fcaf409b0b672c46a2bd51"],"referencesCount":2,"citationsCount":142,"abstract":"Thomas E.

This year, the winds brought smoke from the fires into Sao Paulo, so thick that—after encountering moist air blowing from the ocean—the afternoon skies were darkened and street lights had to be lit 3 hours early for the city to continue to function.

When it rains on the Amazonian forest landscape, at least 75% of the moisture is returned to the westward-moving air mass. The rainforest recycles the moisture five to six times before it turns southward, feeling the proximity of the high wall of the Andes.

Correlation analyses indicate a delay in the onset of 0.12–0.17 days per percent increase in deforestation. Analysis of cumulative probability density functions emphasizes that the likelihood of rainy season onset occurring earlier than normal decreases as the local deforestation fraction increases. In addition, the probability of occurrence of dry spells in the early and late rainy season is higher in areas with greater deforestation. The delayed onset and longer dry spell events in highly deforested areas increase the climate risk to agriculture in the region."},{"id":"505e022f19daaf96a59040e72c7194599c219af7","numberInSourceReferences":33,"doi":"10.5194/ESSD-12-177-2020","type":null,"title":"The Global Long-term Microwave Vegetation Optical Depth Climate Archive VODCA","authors":[{"id":"115291346","LN":"Moesinger","FN":"Leander"},{"id":"2007307172","LN":"Zotta","FN":"Ruxandra-Maria"},{"id":"151419715","LN":"Schalie","FN":"Robin van der"},{"id":"3511387","LN":"Forkel","FN":"M."},{"id":"40235393","LN":"Scanlon","FN":"T."},{"id":"30959101","LN":"Teubner","FN":"Irene E."},{"id":"134632334","LN":"Jeu","FN":"R. de"},{"id":"1688378","LN":"Dorigo","FN":"W."}],"year":2019,"date":"2019-04-15","journal":"Earth System Science Data","references":["d7d47572930bbeb21b91b398df050b6e71cbe785","e5848787cc4ab12d6636c5a5ba23112fc31d75a7","3847b83264a110b1fa85efc21002dbdcfee701b8","1dc6fde41a4236a778bf2ce93e53411110ad91d6","879a1756a7e218e4c23511ac84b61ab181ab640a","2055c468a3bc4ab348c8d239fce91edb7d27aae3","0312d6dbd89b7fe721e8d54c2f1ac378e57bd4b9","89a264c9f08ba51f16a93e98b5d1ca0e70f942a3","61482897d130f8d73fc3f167ca8113b4e008ae6c","91652419beaaabca6038ccd1b16c29a5f81c966d","fda07f3c725f2851ebd65f85d6535bd1e843efb5","c0d58faacb626079a2c1eb595880bfbc89a09ec4","bdb8ba46c9747edb86d9ca5b5c8e82d76ad01378","b1d177e8274d198b22d8cc6d742f4f2fa640ea58","6bb3a5f225675d802c4dea656c35e3da2e444515","595994ea3d6d5bce055c94a8dd8e030a91a57fdd","22ada00aac87fd2ad0d1835386111f12a91f80bd","9a17d3f6c299606195547d5b94c883a46dee4b4f","5495cc817a20ca0706ff79f70d8fc52c464c596c","1dec3245eb094c789d81fa3e172982af4ee33574","aae42b28f188ddca4c3d23c28633d4723f86c5a7","2c3f0e22ba0ce08b3811afa1239c1ef4307b2c0f","1ccb70ca28b63cf5187d1fa660e202c44091e924","f5ca30ccf6222431c271c2c8672b842916806bbc","0d3f34db3b90d48fddaac721782f0401e1ab34d2","f5dc0cbf426013ddd0f074f0b1208cf98192978e","dd483b6709c3b9fbb9635bbff8cf62c143c7a5d5","ed864e22c34e43c7f939aa764cb2ae81b5771185","0b2d742dd0fe129e484622ca9ca4097fb1649f66","3076711ef383096cdeb599bf7168fb2d43b0d6f7","177385a8671f541812dbc14610891326185ec431","f077ed850896a9f361e29759894cc9cbc3059c00","5c52081d5dec619fd591bec19b9672cbadb0602e","e2e16f3c123850dffbb38765ef8fd71ebaecdaca","b047a56d832a80653fa99252dc005ac5d5bfe55c","6bf6589b8979c28bd739104c9ec7c2b014f3e309","44fa9af8cd96fd73aba1f7ea6c55620dddac23f7","c1fee2b7682c35aeb1caf3b8e28cc87691379095","f26d2908c2ea6d9d4e76cac3a244652617f23b84","9cf0c5d523f083fcab91760ed96b0d3d1ebb0b99","6ad2fd7a469701e6ca208180057036fc6c5a89bd","51ad9216faea7d92f797571931ff3c67b86c7cfc","a254fbf63c3a3df9b8918432f1c17e1f41ec6d62","c6e7ff04f80ca3d34b3af1a46aabefd8718f60df","268e50c10f32481f9d15b25cb2cb530090b7d0bc","abfcd9139be4a4505902fb787adab7b686365c1f","f9b46b7c16956e792821185c5ef3eed5a5b4cec6","e403b9fd7c2f3f6380d72f978490362b99f46c3d","3daf5c30d9fb6e27ea3a5f44d30475988a83bf7e","8d8910f855ac27dc41e3034650064988007c075a","1b42be4c685d3b79d4ccb661d218a6db6080959a","2b0a7825437868625a7afe508a72b53db013a62b","0c396e11fa8a962ebe46936ed319ca1051096449","db5875b249485c33bed0fb7d2baaa109c3b4e4f4","ebe924b7f6c21e29f83cbbce96abf1417e400d04","1673bede20fd42a3b3aba40a1ced653bc206a379","19a6a05e802e42bdf560d258a4497335cd9e1f4f","56a90938d5bfea6040023979934b1e0ff2d67783","91f92ca8b4fe294c9a1eb4f5c6f2a2b84030b8d1","a5bb8da8f3ced8dfde323295e5d813bd43898733","24fc4534f0742af1218dc89b492dfe56a0b087e0","01f5955a3e483bd3a483be4246c90304c5ce7cae",null,null,null,"3ffb691778307d004ebd22e5c2eca0f320f6841a","b179af53ef1060a82467d09f2e0410475866a4c5",null,null,null,null],"referencesCount":71,"citationsCount":148,"abstract":"\\n <p>Since the late 1970s, spaceborne microwave radiometers have been providing measurements of radiation emitted by the Earth&#8217;s surface. From these measurements it is possible to derive vegetation optical depth (VOD), a model-based indicator related to the density, biomass, and water content of vegetation. Because of its high temporal resolution and long availability, VOD can be used to monitor short- to long-term changes in vegetation. However, studying long-term VOD dynamics is generally hampered by the relatively short time span covered by the individual microwave sensors. This can potentially be overcome by merging multiple VOD products into a single climate data record. However, combining multiple sensors into a single product is challenging as systematic differences between input products like biases, different temporal and spatial resolutions and coverage need to be overcome.</p><p><br>Here, we present a new series of long-term VOD products, the VOD Climate Archive (VODCA; Moesinger et al., 2019). VODCA combines VOD retrievals that have been derived from multiple sensors (SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, Windsat and AMSR-2) using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model. We produce separate VOD products for microwave observations in different spectral bands, namely Ku-band (period 1987-2017), X-band (1997-2018) and C-band (2002-2018). In this way, our multi-band VOD products preserve the unique characteristics of each frequency with respect to the structural elements of the canopy. Our merging approach builds on an existing approach that is used to merge satellite products of surface soil moisture<sup>1,2</sup>.&#160;</p><p><br>The characteristics of VODCA are assessed for self-consistency and against other products. Using an autocorrelation analysis, we show that the merging of the multiple data sets successfully reduces the random error compared to the input data sets. Spatio-temporal patterns and anomalies of the merged products show consistency between frequencies and with Leaf Area Index observations from the MODIS instrument as well as with Vegetation Continuous Fields from the AVHRR instruments. Long-term trends in Ku-Band VODCA show that since 1987 there has been a decline in VOD in the tropics and in large parts of east-central and north Asia, while a substantial increase is observed in India, large parts of Australia, southern Africa, southeastern China and central north America. In summary, VODCA shows vast potential for monitoring spatial-temporal ecosystem changes as it is sensitive to vegetation water content and unaffected by cloud cover or high sun zenith angles. As such it complements existing long-term optical indices of greenness and leaf area.&#160;</p><p><sup>1</sup>Gruber, A., Scanlon, T., van der Schalie, R., Wagner, W., Dorigo, W.

A crucial nonlinear mechanism for the existence of this tipping point is the positive melt-elevation feedback: Melting reduces ice sheet height, exposing the ice sheet surface to warmer temperatures, which further accelerates melting. We reveal early-warning signals for a forthcoming critical transition from ice-core-derived height reconstructions and infer that the western Greenland Ice Sheet has been losing stability in response to rising temperatures. We show that the melt-elevation feedback is likely to be responsible for the observed destabilization. Our results suggest substantially enhanced melting in the near future. The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is a potentially unstable component of the Earth system and may exhibit a critical transition under ongoing global warming. Mass reductions of the GrIS have substantial impacts on global sea level and the speed of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, due to the additional freshwater caused by increased meltwater runoff into the northern Atlantic. The stability of the GrIS depends crucially on the positive melt-elevation feedback (MEF), by which melt rates increase as the overall ice sheet height decreases under rising temperatures. Melting rates across Greenland have accelerated nonlinearly in recent decades, and models predict a critical temperature threshold beyond which the current ice sheet state is not maintainable. Here, we investigate long-term melt rate and ice sheet height reconstructions from the central-western GrIS in combination with model simulations to quantify the stability of this part of the GrIS. We reveal significant early-warning signals (EWS) indicating that the central-western GrIS is close to a critical transition. By relating the statistical EWS to underlying physical processes, our results suggest that the MEF plays a dominant role in the observed, ongoing destabilization of the central-western GrIS. Our results suggest substantial further GrIS mass loss in the near future and call for urgent, observation-constrained stability assessments of other parts of the GrIS.","tldr":"Long-term melt rate and ice sheet height reconstructions from the central-western GrIS are investigated in combination with model simulations to quantify the stability of this part of the GrIS and suggest substantial further GrIS mass loss in the near future."},{"id":"5c6a907a418896b8aee17663e8c87895c1622fd3","numberInSourceReferences":31,"doi":"10.1038/S41558-021-01097-4","type":null,"title":"Observation-based early-warning signals for a collapse of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation","authors":[{"id":"49920070","LN":"Boers","FN":"N."}],"year":2021,"date":"2021-08-01","journal":"Nature Climate Change","volume":"11","firstPage":"680","lastPage":"688","references":["0e56e9006d1a992de243e129025a000f3bc791a4","3d9b7c8ce26dad35dfac58642ebe17b100a770ef","3dea643893221f22cfb9a10a0976cd7ffcebdde5","3b45b094846d08739d80caf9ea734f0b536b6e0a","03ca75ab7f117c1d56dc86f53592461ff6ccc932","9caba192412655d921a1254fcca807cb3ee44b4c","3be6c4805b97f9d5b0780317e1a079a1a0b6a2b9","074f5ca4c823c806d3ef09bae9ebfdfb5f99713a","21f5816d86ba63813e5577175ff0a3a91230ef83","809c3a4b4417a97a879a5b43191c3329627ea17a","fd43c9fcea1b32d98523800308539dab02937a1e","c2dae083b5d082978b1994dc79c19d32a0b3274a","3e7d27f19939236d423eb50b7fd2a41c0a75f770","d29499176341f41ce08a2401750b5f3a0bb55b25","7ea7e4f3f7519d433d6343be0ea1c1dc094ecd06","12e24ffae041240f57e8fd711168bea8f6a59851","e25e0c03b571c6a1fcf16dbee17b0fa5f625cc1c","5494ddf65de21fb76874de9965cdc2030b70adf3","d3abc3ee8e73350e20273db799c6e1c5ad7fa452","21a90973a461ed3abb64ae02cf0202009fa88ba4","10c9d9296f2f62ed876acdc9a7faad8eb0c2ae96","9e2b5146d43268cde0a223c4ebafead8b63d7528","a591162ef4abf98dcbad0b8a14b95b8c3dfcd8ae","958fe4590f04472c3e914045cebb1ed72b5c17cd","cbf56bec97c2eed53a5713912b268d1efd2d10d0","e0d6dd2c5cda949d143dcbe130f367bff3eb9934","609c6de604f6bb444cc021a0551bedd0f3023877","54118303ed178ee7f102e34609d7c526d25edd71","93d96b3754cc473036dc2061cdb31c7316cdd32a","d8c0b8fac1416ff8eba7b463509b8fd5fe2f35f1","14ac2f766c7e86aa87321f81e6fb91d6d45e57a2","5f4baf9dcfa83fea6feb6492ec746193313cb8a1","340a367252fa11d5c99e5b57e483ca0b9ece0de6","f4a23c448a2a3075c9956e973ab9ad5782b5e53a","b22b40906454d3eec7fdbd79bef269e2ad2fe096","5aa322ea3005a6375eb59ab5cf8c985ca7124508","0ddd687dcfc35bb318a2b75be7cdbfbc287e85c5","6a54c0791e97836fb98a8abffda4974af5a66229","9758a5cb826ed7199ee8822f08108fd6bbf7a106","c04f8d58d460fa0f16b89063b6a2251973686afb","402330be796707ca7856f814c9fa7ce6f7ecc2e9","6ef5f14bee23e150535bbc780b5ad0066ad7021d","c5e8862bfd224b8078a77655602c910963df75d3","7bc019d3bf9b9ecc293c6e97b1b76055ced6692d","a8f2928e5a793206b0d40289e7f763f6ad76fbe9","4d41108590a7823ea9b943bd4c614534edba3b8d","bc809d384ea2fdc507be9fa84ed0f21b5c66b789","389ec712b590cba24a184aa9704bcfad0970f1b0","185839f463430585cba7156ccf3d608ed56598e9","8c6e3842dac2b493532d7d76a7945b420cdddf88","2cfa67696a36298c5a1dd5c3f6e52479ee9081eb","70fae121f412c19612115eff06c13134b8cb2060","7411530aa26843b62f9174fa9d004bab72e476dc","7be1503a792568ba35e9ba65a6a98876dc2bc808","36a509d35869b5c11a2a5ffab1fd2ec85f4f739d","15542c6d47b8b40998daf02ea65678d23bb24ae5","c076a09e667635f2ccaa3cd36b9cc4ca0258cd7b","0c4b8f4d27d7f37673331ebd9402d160f2360f76","ae24213e213c8a3b6ec752c62ebc0d14595808fb","fb0f84092776169eb2afde1c08c884b7100f14b2","63e1d8f990205bf7de27adf0189f502f365c1520",null,null,null],"referencesCount":64,"citationsCount":148,"abstract":null},{"id":"f7014c1b0b2e820ba82a017924590f3098b49910","numberInSourceReferences":4,"doi":"10.1038/S41586-021-03629-6","type":["JournalArticle"],"title":"Amazonia as a carbon source linked to deforestation and climate change","authors":[{"id":"39180211","LN":"Gatti","FN":"L."},{"id":"34014240","LN":"Basso","FN":"L."},{"id":"2220078865","LN":"Miller","FN":"John B."},{"id":"1914617344","LN":"Gloor","FN":"M."},{"id":"2119570914","LN":"Domingues","FN":"Lucas Gatti"},{"id":"69951942","LN":"Cassol","FN":"H."},{"id":"14675529","LN":"Tejada","FN":"Graciela"},{"id":"143710790","LN":"Aragão","FN":"L."},{"id":"48778877","LN":"Nobre","FN":"C."},{"id":"48304008","LN":"Peters","FN":"W."},{"id":"90157891","LN":"Marani","FN":"L."},{"id":"35046261","LN":"Arai","FN":"E."},{"id":"2119557552","LN":"Sanches","FN":"Alber H."},{"id":"12917908","LN":"Corrêa","FN":"S."},{"id":"144659017","LN":"Anderson","FN":"L."},{"id":"8961038","LN":"Randow","FN":"C. von"},{"id":"108428610","LN":"Correia","FN":"Caio S.

Here we reveal that if the Amazon region becomes drier as predicted, forests may collapse first on seasonally inundated areas due to their vulnerability to wildfires. The widespread distribution of floodplain forests at the western and central regions implies that fire-prone savannas may expand deep into this massive forest biome, threatening the resilience of the entire system. Our findings suggest the need for a strategic fire management plan to strengthen Amazonian forest resilience in the face of climate change. The massive forests of central Amazonia are often considered relatively resilient against climatic variation, but this view is challenged by the wildfires invoked by recent droughts. The impact of such fires that spread from pervasive sources of ignition may reveal where forests are less likely to persist in a drier future. Here we combine field observations with remotely sensed information for the whole Amazon to show that the annually inundated lowland forests that run through the heart of the system may be trapped relatively easily into a fire-dominated savanna state. This lower forest resilience on floodplains is suggested by patterns of tree cover distribution across the basin, and supported by our field and remote sensing studies showing that floodplain fires have a stronger and longer-lasting impact on forest structure as well as soil fertility. Although floodplains cover only 14% of the Amazon basin, their fires can have substantial cascading effects because forests and peatlands may release large amounts of carbon, and wildfires can spread to adjacent uplands.

This study uses daily rainfall data from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission 3B42 product and a recent yearly 1‐km land use dataset to evaluate the quantitative effects of deforestation on the onset, demise and length of the rainy season in southern Amazon for a period of 15 years (1998–2012). Additionally, we use the Niño4 index, zonal wind data and deforestation data to explain and predict the interannual variability of the onset of the rainy season. During this period, onset has delayed ~0.38 ± 0.05 days per year (5.7 ± 0.75 days in 15 years), demise has advanced 1.34 ± 0.76 days per year (20 ± 11.4 days in 15 years) and the rainy season has shortened by 1.81 ± 0.97 days per year (27 ± 14.5 days in 15 years). Onset, demise and length also present meridional and zonal gradients linked to large‐scale climate mechanisms. After removing the effects related to geographical position and year, we verified a relationship between onset, demise and length and deforestation: Onset delays ~0.4 ± 0.12 day, demise advances ~1.0 ± 0.22 day and length decreases ~0.9 ± 0.34 day per each 10% deforestation increase relative to existing forested area. We also present empirical evidence of the interaction between large‐scale and local‐scale processes, with interannual variation of the onset in the region explained by Niño4 sea surface temperature anomalies, Southern Hemisphere subtropical jet position, deforestation and their interactions (r2 = 69%, p < .001, mean absolute error = 2.7 days)."},{"id":"434ca529b68aabfb4835ac2cb8a8a3da6f83efe1","numberInSourceReferences":48,"doi":"10.1088/1748-9326/AB9CFF","type":null,"title":"An early-warning indicator for Amazon droughts exclusively based on tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures","authors":[{"id":"11342353","LN":"Ciemer","FN":"Catrin"},{"id":"1672379569","LN":"Rehm","FN":"Lars"},{"id":"143842718","LN":"Kurths","FN":"J."},{"id":"2995629","LN":"Donner","FN":"R."},{"id":"47177709","LN":"Winkelmann","FN":"R."},{"id":"49920070","LN":"Boers","FN":"N."}],"year":2020,"date":"2020-06-15","journal":"Environmental Research Letters","volume":"15","references":["7eb633f568c0be35e77b1ddadf7d867c3ed0cb14","a3f78c433942f915a40cc0f994056d286b611ff1","30b58ad6dfff36f7366df9f2b851466f796b967b","824fbf100b6b2a569abda5347f31b40270783f56","12334afe89c06c07a1409d4442a1d51c26e10d93","6f44552f1a1e9752610efab648b10d1bba6148f7","ed8713ca0d4e263cbb12c0da16fe56d6abc732fd","4c0bfb8b92b287f58c0487c79e4083f5b8b4a552","e317820eff7bf69a4989edec5054dc541e88d77d","65989ad6a285e94fce9a180d82266a9e1c51dc1e","fbac5ff94174ca783e731a7a4007c96248288bfe","365ab3e5a0b058d8acf37cf03687d83b9a8941c6","821d1bad58a5697a4a521bf169a256b9ca34084a","d2d1c5b6db0a49162e26cbe3681aba5746dac515","1dc886ac2f208422112e7670647c99b5e22966ed","50963d76d9ba8b0e39cbe5616234a1cc87cae52e","acc59a30d83ff1a9b64e0ab38918baf635b1891d","0bd45c23f2e32de7edf334432a765842883b0968","a010b76e1a809da5a128def075a310b1b1511593","2ef3d560d93620d057ce0fc65b07e6267a9aff31","a8cc30f4e21e94e2789615df4d08c05d9e7c66c7","37a09c5884e85fb6481e8bbd06724fa5ab293a39","354f931b92a51180bbeaf49f89d662ee7984ab50","1d2b88cdca8f382dce619b818b562b85f7e17411","a5765169625611cbd0f322b26e7eff2bfb98c1ef","1605448e0a7784977cbf1cfb09f3d3b0ce9533d2","12771dd7bbcfc1d025aa4e6379bbf6a31cb51d18","852a3dff0d0f852641d5de3daa93dc57c570e6f2","ff77d554e4174900682f17e13834b1a56052fb81","0316374ff1199b079471543f239fe68622a97cec","d5c6603b13e566d0c1508db4ed82e517f18253b6","38ac8621e56003d0c91ecf4e3d24f403f28d5a9d","d73b49915376faf12fa1a1ea803faab9d701caee","ba9eebacf27fed90db8b1ec70c3ef6446a144cfd","68b7efac05d1761d3ada2419bbdeb37220566bf5","762aa6130506c839e3dfe7fc2e15b4962aa41b94","4097d1d38c786f89b895eb17daaf2de1d1a79b14","c3f7136d6cb726b295eb34565a8270177c57f40f"],"referencesCount":38,"citationsCount":19,"abstract":"Droughts in tropical South America have an imminent and severe impact on the Amazon rainforest and affect the livelihoods of millions of people. Extremely dry conditions in Amazonia have been previously linked to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the adjacent tropical oceans. Although the sources and impacts of such droughts have been widely studied, establishing reliable multi-year lead statistical forecasts of their occurrence is still an ongoing challenge. Here, we further investigate the relationship between SST and rainfall anomalies using a complex network approach. We identify four ocean regions which exhibit the strongest overall SST correlations with central Amazon rainfall, including two particularly prominent regions in the northern and southern tropical Atlantic. Based on the time-dependent correlation between SST anomalies in these two regions alone, we establish a new early-warning method for droughts in the central Amazon basin and demonstrate its robustness in hindcasting past major drought events with lead-times up to 18 months."},{"numberInSourceReferences":57,"title":"Missing: 10.5281/ZENODO.5837469 (id not found in

The global climate models for the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fourth Assessment Report (IPCC AR4) predict very different changes of rainfall over the Amazon under the SRES A1B scenario for global climate change. Five of the eleven models predict an increase of annual rainfall, three models predict a decrease of rainfall, and the other three models predict no significant changes in the Amazon rainfall. We have further examined two models. The UKMO-HadCM3 model predicts an El Nino-like sea surface temperature (SST) change and warming in the northern tropical Atlantic which appear to enhance atmospheric subsidence and consequently reduce clouds over the Amazon. The resultant increase of surface solar absorption causes a stronger surface sensible heat flux and thus reduces relative humidity of the surface air. These changes decrease the rate and length of wet season rainfall and surface latent heat flux. This decreased wet season rainfall leads to drier soil during the subsequent dry season, which in turn can delay the transition from the dry to wet season. GISS-ER predicts a weaker SST warming in the western Pacific and the southern tropical Atlantic which increases moisture transport and hence rainfall in the Amazon. In the southern Amazon and Nordeste where the strongest rainfall increase occurs, the resultant higher soil moisture supports a higher surface latent heat flux during the dry and transition season and leads to an earlier wet season onset."},{"id":"2f78828a333f2c2ba7f5c793ce26f380d5fc89fa","numberInSourceReferences":7,"doi":"10.1029/2006GL028946","type":null,"title":"Spatial patterns and fire response of recent Amazonian droughts","authors":[{"id":"143710790","LN":"Aragão","FN":"L."},{"id":"48401102","LN":"Malhi","FN":"Y."},{"id":"1403548522","LN":"Roman-Cuesta","FN":"R."},{"id":"1688112","LN":"Saatchi","FN":"S."},{"id":"144659017","LN":"Anderson","FN":"L."},{"id":"3391591","LN":"Shimabukuro","FN":"Y."}],"year":2007,"date":"2007-04-01","journal":"Geophysical Research Letters","volume":"34","references":["987fc140593dfa3e3990b0702be40f706989eed4","ebdf988f8836af804c39fb27ac77831c0b4f8199","8a331f5a3e5ee466fd8920ab57f3b08f67cf2843","609cd0bc2351ddb76777332c95db3ef8a2b04f3a","b1bb849237edf695b4185a9bf9855fa1fe1306a5","4d322876371e3d284b9fa663f205c0dcbb98d5c7","96a630a6cd9049bd66593c88b8ceb52675192ef7","090256bdc67eace0034cdc673595803cede39617","12771dd7bbcfc1d025aa4e6379bbf6a31cb51d18","2856df3bd23a719593c0adc3ab2f95aa419596cb","fbfb5fb4646201931a819cb96a7b7971a45de5ca","cb79bdaeffbebfa6de28582756e97a8bd57ba995","6143cc9b7aedd9e5e6033d4c09b7d55c6356fc31","319fd12a60b838ad7dda305c16e23fc6ae7aa841","57f990c3ba70ab8fbb913a99a3f8d5b5460f62a6","d580add46161cc71662f2a2bb4b7b18cbf03d996","bbd2a717137e2c8e76498e9f9cbada34dea27242","2dbb1000eb776711f9e3c76a0f78d5f12668910f","47d2fa4504dc29955cc48c7dcffbdbbb38a17781","0d099590f6efe76f8f88bb11034720f73a9b1ae4",null,null],"referencesCount":22,"citationsCount":492,"abstract":"There has been an increasing awareness of the possibility of climate change causing increased drought frequency in Amazonia, with ensuing impacts on ecosystems and human populations.

The drought severely affected human population along the main channel of the Amazon River and its western and southwestern tributaries, the Solimoes (also known as the Amazon River in the other Amazon countries) and the Madeira Rivers, respectively. The river levels fell to historic low levels and navigation along these rivers had to be suspended. The drought did not affect central or eastern Amazonia, a pattern different from the El Nino–related droughts in 1926, 1983, and 1998. The choice of rainfall data used influenced the detection of the drought. While most datasets (station or gridded data) showed negative departures from mean rainfall, one dataset exhibited above-normal rainfall in western Amazonia. The causes of the drought were not related to El Nino but to (i) the anomalously warm tropical North Atlantic, (ii) the reduced intensity in northeast trade wind moisture tr..."},{"id":"4ee0ec1e47aa74424a0a090f73b8603d776cb6ce","numberInSourceReferences":3,"doi":"10.1073/PNAS.0804619106","type":["JournalArticle"],"title":"Exploring the likelihood and mechanism of a climate-change-induced dieback of the Amazon rainforest","authors":[{"id":"48401102","LN":"Malhi","FN":"Y."},{"id":"143710790","LN":"Aragão","FN":"L."},{"id":"34946876","LN":"Galbraith","FN":"D."},{"id":"2804586","LN":"Huntingford","FN":"C."},{"id":"49353300","LN":"Fisher","FN":"R."},{"id":"50088996","LN":"Zelazowski","FN":"P."},{"id":"3728155","LN":"Sitch","FN":"S."},{"id":"144690723","LN":"McSweeney","FN":"C."},{"id":"144938923","LN":"Meir","FN":"P."}],"year":2009,"date":"2009-12-08","journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","volume":"106","firstPage":"20610","lastPage":"20615","references":["37a09c5884e85fb6481e8bbd06724fa5ab293a39","62361cb63ed1c54d09063a13a98d946a1a635e8a","1563068db0707d4cedcc14b4de057ab117fbed50","80409f2342be237a797ac94d5095efa57a55ec42","d7b4a30c881f74acf8eae8cf4ccc79ef5d0437a3","2eed542cfb60b30f4fe0dbfa54b573398ba6993e","ad291bd5b21860267afd7c5a1fc6d44148de71cf","cd340ab18afaab2163fcf109ce3b8a9db7a268ce","87be4d31120aaeed69e8329fbed88594ef6c9a30","863c42b6f9ca86a8eba8105a064a7a5b01ec07d6","389ec712b590cba24a184aa9704bcfad0970f1b0","706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","e3b85621274dad81a33ec4b7d07e3ba1857597dc","da3b009864e1f75e882f3713a50e0de7bd977aa9","1d8c6d421da1e01e9e3c0cade4904de9e4240452","a6dba705b97fa5345374bd275ca5b08498f174f1","2f78828a333f2c2ba7f5c793ce26f380d5fc89fa","cfc1a3fbd2fe229045e0c53f7f9609e80ab3f8d5","8a331f5a3e5ee466fd8920ab57f3b08f67cf2843","a8ee4ef420c2c6a90ee221bcb74b1663e111675c","91887a0bf5788a99ac5a7cf130bcf60cf8e79c75","4923d201cc50dc60ea1c78dd42b6092ce7e8863e","29e0b01bab1c7cea2a91f55ff0624162654ef127","7afcd328055f1e18f9f5e5f744f677e6c1427785","53919d771d66d723a5eeacf39a655206ab92d86a","35ab138c1c0b0d83023abada822992191eea0e69","a637f09be32f8ff15cf16b60321aaa74cb208ac1","090256bdc67eace0034cdc673595803cede39617","b9bfa59b4e92d76d84a5041438427663f87e2b1c","614f0a07eab4d3240918acda9ca6180b58e89b19","3ec481005e118dfdfbc6c0d5eff267eacf9e2c0a","193157d65ace8bac8625d3617de42e5516bf653a","0f43146e8240f1204a7f1884311c17236d331d6b","361c5a402b8e61f2df3bf7356b656c7c69264221",null,null,"4d619b602c109930fccec728c2ad11b5da84c062"],"referencesCount":37,"citationsCount":869,"abstract":"We examine the evidence for the possibility that 21st-century climate change may cause a large-scale “dieback” or degradation of Amazonian rainforest. We employ a new framework for evaluating the rainfall regime of tropical forests and from this deduce precipitation-based boundaries for current forest viability. We then examine climate simulations by 19 global climate models (GCMs) in this context and find that most tend to underestimate current rainfall. GCMs also vary greatly in their projections of future climate change in Amazonia. We attempt to take into account the differences between GCM-simulated and observed rainfall regimes in the 20th century. Our analysis suggests that dry-season water stress is likely to increase in E. Amazonia over the 21st century, but the region tends toward a climate more appropriate to seasonal forest than to savanna. These seasonal forests may be resilient to seasonal drought but are likely to face intensified water stress caused by higher temperatures and to be vulnerable to fires, which are at present naturally rare in much of Amazonia. The spread of fire ignition associated with advancing deforestation, logging, and fragmentation may act as nucleation points that trigger the transition of these seasonal forests into fire-dominated, low biomass forests. Conversely, deliberate limitation of deforestation and fire may be an effective intervention to maintain Amazonian forest resilience in the face of imposed 21st-century climate change. Such intervention may be enough to navigate E. Amazonia away from a possible “tipping point,” beyond which extensive rainforest would become unsustainable.","tldr":"A new framework for evaluating the rainfall regime of tropical forests is employed and from this precipitation-based boundaries for current forest viability are deduced, suggesting that dry-season water stress is likely to increase in E.

The Amazon rainforest is among the Earth’s climate tipping elements. Under ongoing global warming, the frequency of severe droughts such as in 2005 and 2010 is projected to increase strongly, up to the point where these droughts may become the new climate normal in the second half of this century. Taking into account the adaptation of the forest to past environmental conditions, we find that nonlinear thresholds in the hydrological balance of the rainforest might be exceeded under drier future conditions, leading to self-amplified forest transitions. Thereby, we reveal that the lack of moisture recycling in some parts of the forest can be propagated downwind by the reduction of atmospheric moisture transport, resulting in approximately one-third

Radical and quick transformations towards sustainability will be fundamental to achieving a more sustainable future. However, deliberate interventions to reconfigure systems will result in winners and losers, with the potential for greater or lesser equity and justice outcomes. Positive tipping points (PTPs) have been proposed as interventions in complex systems with the aim to (a) reduce the likelihood of negative Earth system tipping points and/or (b) increase the likelihood of achieving just social foundations. However, many narratives around PTPs often do not take into account the entire spectrum of impacts the proposed alternatives could have or still rely on narratives that maintain current unsustainable behaviours and marginalize many people (i.e. do not take “b” into account). One such example is the move from petrol-based to electric vehicles. An energy transition that remains based on natural resource inputs from the Global South must be unpacked with an equity and justice lens to understand the true cost of this transition. There are two arguments why a critical engagement with these and other similar proposals needs to be made. First, the idea of transitioning through a substitution (e.g. of fuel) while maintaining the system structure (e.g. of private vehicles) may not necessarily be conceived as the kind of radical transformation being called for by global scientific bodies like the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES). Second, and probably more importantly, the question of positive for whom, positive where, and positive how must be considered. In this paper, we unpack these narratives using a critical decolonial view from the south and outline their implications for the concept of tipping points.\\n"}],"tabLabel":"Amazon deforestation","tabTitle":"Pronounced loss of Amazon rainforest resilience since the early 2000s","bookmarkletURL":"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00857-9","API":"Semantic Scholar","allReferences":false,"allCitations":false,"timestamp":1717837822662,"localCitationNetworkVersion":1.24}]
