Deforestation and climate change, via increasing dry-season length and drought frequency, may already have pushed the Amazon close to a critical threshold of rainforest dieback. Here, we quantify changes of Amazon resilience by applying established indicators (for example, measuring lag-1 autocorrelation) to remotely sensed vegetation data with a focus on vegetation optical depth (1991–2016). We find that more than three-quarters of the Amazon rainforest has been losing resilience since the early 2000s, consistent with the approach to a critical transition. Resilience is being lost faster in regions with less rainfall and in parts of the rainforest that are closer to human activity. We provide direct empirical evidence that the Amazon rainforest is losing resilience, risking dieback with profound implications for biodiversity, carbon storage and climate change at a global scale. The Amazon rainforest is increasingly under pressure from climate change and deforestation. The resilience of three-quarters of the forest, particularly in drier areas or close to human activity, has been decreasing since the 2000s, indicating that the system may be approaching a tipping point.","isSource":true},"input":[{"id":"fedd542a6c24f5dc2fc3b5cf8391326a605ccf85","doi":"10.1038/35041539","title":"Acceleration of global warming due to carbon-cycle feedbacks in a coupled climate model","authors":[{"LN":"Cox","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Betts","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Jones","FN":"Chris D."},{"LN":"Spall","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Totterdell","FN":"I."}],"year":2000,"journal":"Nature","references":["02f38501ebcee6d44b067f866948e0f90082ec2c","04b356ee5eaa20a0242a6bca3a11a0e8344f16f1","05db0efd9d655d92aa895e4e1544bb76593401e1","096ff39ae28696f34a880151969e82809fe012da","0f22ce024aa171f62f5677b68afda409ee29fcb0","21e0679d9c7195a1e4d3953062223420a88a2fa9","27858105804671f2c6d3a406f06811bf88eb9349","2943c165f95fecb7a4f6ae37703a11697962f4be","2cbfe6ad53bb8d7c4319004372575d8dec992f99","2dc0ffa894a984a29ed90802a0de08f2032243d2","2fbcdd66c7ddcc5ca9ee04aeead8efe98eb3ad0e","3736437795ecc7da99cdb99be2931dd999d5449e","38dff19e82bfa09ba43c6955522f0ae4f5a9a99c","393556db45d0930625c3c7520dc4883a4b43ea00","3954607ae9d1ad4ea3f9821d4c5ede76fbfa9d66","3b85b997300edbd27c5df88245b874b959f74bd4","3dad4545b3723c9cc01f729a9679564888f95691","3f99f268a65485c77adfcebb8de0454cfe1f9a2a","401a58bc3ea36610fc20905dd8a22dea6b28c139","40871ce647aab03834231540cae0001ba89def16","45d9fdf6606a5409f4fef8a01f80f239a1346062","4796974189d692e9671db9cd57270e596371a2f8","5586e9f2faa596778d2935feb05326f6b8b52ccc","59b3b31bb5b742b5dea9383695794e8e50f4b54a","59b972d04f4892df7817f954048e78386dc3a54d","5d8266b960ffffc0a4db2d5da1f366e4536bbef4","6560eab8e3d009a9d90bb723b019db97288a10dc","68b26f20cff84997c585ab87fb4ca4881b67974b","6b374d10d5f4c1943a31d214967e53f73c0f7aa4","71a56116bc4f294463bb4863ac33087556df3ed3","72c46f250da2d6aeb3e758dbca6a93e1b14c9798","7b1ff605bdb4706328e5528f95dd266f74711295","7b5ed43d63354f938e5c3d5e35156c5ce487b829","7de7db43a936f5b28d9c75f2f93190e4c89e7bb7","7dedeb1d928ff8c4e6d0d9fccee1abc431bb528d","7e4b0396b57bfc22ec412b353fc489c221d1bf1d","7e558fdf44c2020b90c505670bcdf90ba5fb8628","8618976ad3911f1a760fec7bf5a10ace58ccd42b","9a9cd49e2a55c88727568d5be553bd6214d71df3","9c3a391ffe57874ae80a578f8d0497c17fb66269","a16a59e900bde6572a55f516cbeee4726cc43419","a2eca133337e5826da0b660e7dec1bb4386415c3","a360cfcf37327c0216e528ab62a3032cf6858b69","a6803b6fe197b6e8500a6190a5a63badccb5e55e","a995f2af1eb340b79d9ca99056a780c22c5c7571","aa8bd6520f38204c05330b3dc637d609c26d99cd","ae68e8592b7fcc6da703d1f3d9b0a41a14648d95","af0d814147ea4509a71566de41f35440e45b5ae3","af70b12f6abc3dee863624abadd2224ea60951fe","bcdc63cf9ba72c73a31ce9d05bc43cc98cf130aa","bf1d0f059695e2f81df488f9e85844cca44590b6","c31ec338aa000856c21bc6a78a876fc843af064a","c5dc86913b7cd1335670d2777669720f039196c3","cc081cffff44acac1205c5c3983d19994c31464a","ceb3b4f6c25962a2a8cf3af8d4bf39390af0dacb","d7a2b8b130531b0cb11494117022aed63a5b274a","d8d63d54438012f47c32efe77226bfde015a58d4","ddcc0dd78e653b580194a903390223a104a06a65","e21c08f15bff89ea83c322878c48b7e4aa3fa60d","e74d3b4372a3033c2411f4ecf47012632a74b9d1","ea0a203c474c7166eca3848af299c12069954c9f","ecb546baa3b0388caea34ce23169e55c821eeb4d","ece299d919ba9389f6f546e7fec26578dbdd6fc5","f4c3d185ae0b0ed44765b2c8582671bc49c5db60","ffd0a21c23b80015942622e7ff7ea8e9f4e2e564",null,null],"citationsCount":3759,"abstract":"The continued increase in the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide due to anthropogenic emissions is predicted to lead to significant changes in climate. About half of the current emissions are being absorbed by the ocean and by land ecosystems, but this absorption is sensitive to climate as well as to atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, creating a feedback loop. General circulation models have generally excluded the feedback between climate and the biosphere, using static vegetation distributions and CO2 concentrations from simple carbon-cycle models that do not include climate change. Here we present results from a fully coupled, three-dimensional carbon–climate model, indicating that carbon-cycle feedbacks could significantly accelerate climate change over the twenty-first century. We find that under a ‘business as usual’ scenario, the terrestrial biosphere acts as an overall carbon sink until about 2050, but turns into a source thereafter. By 2100, the ocean uptake rate of 5 Gt C yr-1 is balanced by the terrestrial carbon source, and atmospheric CO2 concentrations are 250 p.p.m.v. higher in our fully coupled simulation than in uncoupled carbon models, resulting in a global-mean warming of 5.5 K, as compared to 4 K without the carbon-cycle feedback."},{"id":"a010b76e1a809da5a128def075a310b1b1511593","doi":"10.1126/SCIENCE.1200807","title":"The 2010 Amazon Drought","authors":[{"LN":"Lewis","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Brando","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Phillips","FN":"O."},{"LN":"Heijden","FN":"G.

This region (Amazonia) is also estimated to contain about one-tenth of the total carbon stored in land ecosystems, and to account for one-tenth of global, net primary productivity. The resilience of the forest to the combined pressures of deforestation and global warming is therefore of great concern, especially as some general circulation models (GCMs) predict a severe drying of Amazonia in the twenty-first century. Here we analyse these climate projections with reference to the 2005 drought in western Amazonia, which was associated with unusually warm North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SSTs). We show that reduction of dry-season (July–October) rainfall in western Amazonia correlates well with an index of the north–south SST gradient across the equatorial Atlantic (the ‘Atlantic N–S gradient’). Our climate model is unusual among current GCMs in that it is able to reproduce this relationship and also the observed twentieth-century multidecadal variability in the Atlantic N–S gradient, provided that the effects of aerosols are included in the model. Simulations for the twenty-first century using the same model show a strong tendency for the SST conditions associated with the 2005 drought to become much more common, owing to continuing reductions in reflective aerosol pollution in the Northern Hemisphere."},{"id":"706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","doi":"10.1126/SCIENCE.1146961","title":"Climate Change, Deforestation, and the Fate of the Amazon","authors":[{"LN":"Malhi","FN":"Y."},{"LN":"Roberts","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Betts","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Killeen","FN":"T."},{"LN":"Li","FN":"Wenhong"},{"LN":"Nobre","FN":"C."}],"year":2008,"journal":"Science","references":["0707bb3c3139e9d3ddc1e9cb37aeb19436c76ed1","090256bdc67eace0034cdc673595803cede39617","20d3df9aa06a397abd78dda35998b5881221c18b","24ad0ab663766a08ee9001b58d725b2af5d3862a","29e0b01bab1c7cea2a91f55ff0624162654ef127","2b0dd59254ed9d1255f817e427ede2c9f53e5e5f","2f78828a333f2c2ba7f5c793ce26f380d5fc89fa","2fbcdd66c7ddcc5ca9ee04aeead8efe98eb3ad0e","34af8278b0a32fb2f5b3889c0e1213cff11e5c84","4426b5271869d6436da107a455af7a44cb888fe8","459ee19c9e39df89c7b5e3c34f9a67198d05de17","4d26fcdc12504863140e64c149e3b9caa61cd303","4d322876371e3d284b9fa663f205c0dcbb98d5c7","4ff8ce4e0c661ea89e0107d81083b6e90841571f","4ffd7867723c4b8de7ca25bd06906e8142c87296","53919d771d66d723a5eeacf39a655206ab92d86a","5ce44e4dce04761cd512f79242511b977a1b9a52","609cd0bc2351ddb76777332c95db3ef8a2b04f3a","614f0a07eab4d3240918acda9ca6180b58e89b19","6f399b82412689b9a0adeadd41d4da507343a174","6fcaeb14809751eeaa8ab071b2651efeb2b52004","794c364f77621bee08b7985c51ef5c9169f4442c","8a331f5a3e5ee466fd8920ab57f3b08f67cf2843","8c403a4d7691dfffc5d55649ebd309dc1171efad","9119754545a6deab1580bc67c56d38e05b32575e","91887a0bf5788a99ac5a7cf130bcf60cf8e79c75","95bc406687c3da6ebecc31a1710eb1207ea75b3d","995d5441acd26da84ce4aa6864876e17d9762c73","a2ffe92732622c4a7321dade663b03f0dc0d998c","a4a3c78685d591735decf34d0eb10a83d0208235","a6dba705b97fa5345374bd275ca5b08498f174f1","a8ee4ef420c2c6a90ee221bcb74b1663e111675c","ab105af393d052eb3c1d8b8115751e1ae58b52b5","b6143f510fd942ea2ebd44dfe80e014b41e7d829","b6178a5917c3d05f7eb15304528960efc83b13e5","b9bfa59b4e92d76d84a5041438427663f87e2b1c","c925b0563a7220f9d16ac85d66c1bd8ca335ca0b","ca3896c4318f728e2872f84fe70e97cfdb68481d","ce2f70fabf3495fa0d661b662c730a971472cc4d","d36feb2e0f610c825e01b1ef2eef187bc61352b3","d768f32a1a7eb76e80f276c217132649497da2a8","d7b66a1f1c7181e2474062552d79cabfa9f0646f","db5c2c422cb1f5fc9ccdc4c01b79904149288f50","dd1bb4e85133c9a51149d1a5d10bb6ff2e595b9b","de0ac973dfb9dde93b4631642094347cfd632491","e386aec723b58437195bad9486d2d6a959fe2a8c","e3b85621274dad81a33ec4b7d07e3ba1857597dc","fb789046671b2615d7c2d5a4e41d9a55c66cfd5b","fbfb5fb4646201931a819cb96a7b7971a45de5ca","fee78ff685c88c2211e19e82b5f7c124f7bc959d",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":1486,"abstract":"The forest biome of Amazonia is one of Earth's greatest biological treasures and a major component of the Earth system.

term “tipping point” commonly refers to a critical threshold at which a tiny perturbation can qualitatively alter the state or development of a system. Here we introduce the term “tipping element” to describe large-scale components of the Earth system that may pass a tipping point. We critically evaluate potential policy-relevant tipping elements in the climate system under anthropogenic forcing, drawing on the pertinent literature and a recent international workshop to compile a short list, and we assess where their tipping points lie.

One explanation for such events of abrupt change is that they happened when the earth system reached a critical tipping point. However, this remains hard to prove for events in the remote past, and it is even more difficult to predict if and when we might reach a tipping point for abrupt climate change in the future. Here, we analyze eight ancient abrupt climate shifts and show that they were all preceded by a characteristic slowing down of the fluctuations starting well before the actual shift. Such slowing down, measured as increased autocorrelation, can be mathematically shown to be a hallmark of tipping points. Therefore, our results imply independent empirical evidence for the idea that past abrupt shifts were associated with the passing of critical thresholds. Because the mechanism causing slowing down is fundamentally inherent to tipping points, it follows that our way to detect slowing down might be used as a universal early warning signal for upcoming catastrophic change. Because tipping points in ecosystems and other complex systems are notoriously hard to predict in other ways, this is a promising perspective."},{"id":"b40f6f5f1f5931a2f902da254405c554e3ca6b9c","doi":"10.1073/PNAS.1302584110","title":"Increased dry-season length over southern Amazonia in recent decades and its implication for future climate projection","authors":[{"LN":"Fu","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Yin","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Li","FN":"Wenhong"},{"LN":"Arias","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Dickinson","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Huang","FN":"Lei"},{"LN":"Chakraborty","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Fernandes","FN":"K."},{"LN":"Liebmann","FN":"B."},{"LN":"Fisher","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Myneni","FN":"R."}],"year":2013,"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","references":["0451af3e636bf74400f8f394fc3ec9d3e69bb0df","06393e8e0d910d8109e56f9310438c63f4625694","086b6041fdf108ddad98d3750930bf661ff7aa5a","17d23b26fc56836ad292a208fd2a55c9d0f68d8b","1d245bc06645e93b7209983bb5afea2cf2c22378","201b76815c9efc63b534b3c20c23423b72b6ec4f","22dd5901a668e7160d3a03c76e3d39dd430821de","268fa058ba37fbb8de27d176d82c167d87855331","2841e22aec66c5f665f4b4b8c69a1e7149a2bfa7","2b0dd59254ed9d1255f817e427ede2c9f53e5e5f","2fb5f8ec6ac6a8ef4bcf6f6add2526a769eee3a2","2fbcdd66c7ddcc5ca9ee04aeead8efe98eb3ad0e","33c6c516c0a1b5bbc2b3b717560b382c4e4a3175","3c8d659422dd8c8a8101556887b603ebc13746fe","3cedb68c3a4c749a76f5cb982a669c716030eadb","4097d1d38c786f89b895eb17daaf2de1d1a79b14","426d997cfac9ea3959ab27e366d769eca901606a","46aca6dc34009401cc3afe723bed6d8ecea77274","48e20beab31430668cc14bceff2fb726d72ce2b8","4ad76e9e4d3e2e0985b8b26e1f5606f262ca103c","50963d76d9ba8b0e39cbe5616234a1cc87cae52e","609cd0bc2351ddb76777332c95db3ef8a2b04f3a","65a3f5f3f06eced6d8dae4dbc8d0a4dcea6548b5","67ea44e559e8e80886defb873fdab9b4f609b657","6a15e58668576cd7e26d689bb682f7bb6c801797","6dfcb2e9c8a609fb7edadedc63e950ce503c7bf3","717fde8d5339ef53154df2448a809e4d85039584","7ec3510a523be21fe3d3f66306572c2202eeb76d","878c531fc7889fb5b6b29733f8b74d186899cfc3","8884e8ebcbca04d1950cd1cb25d50ad9304a5857","8a331f5a3e5ee466fd8920ab57f3b08f67cf2843","8ad71c339fd4ae7c623b9246f5ba70efbef6e05c","8eae17d86e6366f535382447172dfdc2b2c97bc8","97e67208b41ec60e4f426ba8b599f16610ee058e","a010b76e1a809da5a128def075a310b1b1511593","a366037a8f96449063cbd969e88295c78d539e25","a4d62d4658c0a980d31a5e324f8d9c52d326a353","a5a57a5760aea5ff03ba578e1f93b492ebedc0f6","a6dba705b97fa5345374bd275ca5b08498f174f1","acc59a30d83ff1a9b64e0ab38918baf635b1891d","ad12c3c6a7c6057b24cd1145390d91678436ae22","afc68fc8effbffb30de0b6a4c29d2c802900e07b","b0cc7cc671c6b4d251d480a3dda2eb3ba79e8db1","b10de42e76cf9e5c4fac71e94b87dd19d859c457","bab6bc5b33dbbdd580f67e679683b0d328ec280b","bbd95f1cabb83a2bf6a481e467d3f8d78e06242d","c1f4d0ada1bc02630bf78d4808a9d867c98af370","c331d747d84ce490920400a352fa3eeecafc4a7f","ccb1091e8be50a72a2bab3076fdd3a6c6e2179c8","ce3716fc0361f5d4f9b9bdbfd801235d79e570b0","d1700f180eeddb9bb47cba2c93fb641719951d12","d1bbee6e91d70c9d72fe17d8e355c8308a70c671","f3666d7b160eca8cca099fa59fcfd902cba7a860","f8a6c5720f38250695cebbca608c859bd64e9798","f95b245d5266ba81adf1400b9b9d73ade1d09612","fc5430e69fde0676363051a50a550c212f4a7dbb","fedd542a6c24f5dc2fc3b5cf8391326a605ccf85",null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":322,"abstract":"Significance Whether the dry-season length will increase is a central question in determining the fate of the rainforests over Amazonia and the future global atmospheric CO2 concentration. We show observationally that the dry-season length over southern Amazonia has increased significantly since 1979. We do not know what has caused this change, although it resembles the effects of anthropogenic climate change. The global climate models that were presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s fifth assessment report seem to substantially underestimate the variability of the dry-season length. Such a bias implies that the future change of the dry-season length, and hence the risk of rainforest die-back, may be underestimated by the projections of these models. We have observed that the dry-season length (DSL) has increased over southern Amazonia since 1979, primarily owing to a delay of its ending dates (dry-season end, DSE), and is accompanied by a prolonged fire season. A poleward shift of the subtropical jet over South America and an increase of local convective inhibition energy in austral winter (June–August) seem to cause the delay of the DSE in austral spring (September–November). These changes cannot be simply linked to the variability of the tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans. Although they show some resemblance to the effects of anthropogenic forcings reported in the literature, we cannot attribute them to this cause because of inadequate representation of these processes in the global climate models that were presented in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report. These models significantly underestimate the variability of the DSE and DSL and their controlling processes. Such biases imply that the future change of the DSE and DSL may be underestimated by the climate projections provided by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report models. Although it is not clear whether the observed increase of the DSL will continue in the future, were it to continue at half the rate of that observed, the long DSL and fire season that contributed to the 2005 drought would become the new norm by the late 21st century. The large uncertainty shown in this study highlights the need for a focused effort to better understand and simulate these changes over southern Amazonia."},{"id":"53564c45fe0af4889c92f05b04626f7ac739a97a","doi":"10.1007/BF00384470","title":"A universal law of the characteristic return time near thresholds","authors":[{"LN":"Wissel","FN":"C."}],"year":1984,"journal":"Oecologia","references":["02cb771b6f77cf72eb3af89a3cb44186f1404680","0612d3e17f85856741c0d507dda67a51b2d1b064","22bf6bccf7da09e60943040beebcdb2f2a0ff840","2a928eec78ed916acb72bddf2f2b2a3f82552f4d","2f207c612db26bfdc634be6e919c65d72645493e","30d756bd45d2d903190406693ed15375488286b7","4949b2ff83df5a33b94874fa87994d2e6ea80610","52512727b444589a4877537254ee44160a2436c7","57a7a2a034c21707149ba1fa4184cc6cc142781f","58bdeda2c4be279c060034c3eeef495e9d7c7799","5d33d2d2b12b48cce287ed9d3af3402e16e9c959","5ef02e607a36f07989404de1f0d6358d0298aec3","6255af0c89235a7f19eaecc04599a1a4a22e97ec","6dcce7d1787693664bc2cb2f1625f936869c01d8","734e1117aba24ae9c27a841e605dff13d8af4ee7","73afe74ff85c1c8fec1f0d80d70f03655c63f6bb","8900938e735a43c91487da503b31eb7fdf2cf52f","9aec799a38d5b8e73804aa5696dde35406071f8a","cd0ccb911424417924d2b50ddb302e992b870dab","f2780bb69323414077f42c275cab04801c6df10c",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":293,"abstract":"SummaryDramatic changes at thresholds in multiple stable ecosystems may be irreversible if caused by man.

Simulations with a coupled climate–vegetation model show that similarly ecosystems may be committed to significant change after climate stabilization. Targets for stabilizing climate change are often based on considerations of the impacts of different levels of global warming, usually assessing the time of reaching a particular level of warming. However, some aspects of the Earth system, such as global mean temperatures1 and sea level rise due to thermal expansion2 or the melting of large ice sheets3, continue to respond long after the stabilization of radiative forcing. Here we use a coupled climate–vegetation model to show that in turn the terrestrial biosphere shows significant inertia in its response to climate change. We demonstrate that the global terrestrial biosphere can continue to change for decades after climate stabilization. We suggest that ecosystems can be committed to long-term change long before any response is observable: for example, we find that the risk of significant loss of forest cover in Amazonia rises rapidly for a global mean temperature rise above 2 ∘C. We conclude that such committed ecosystem changes must be considered in the definition of dangerous climate change, and subsequent policy development to avoid it."},{"id":"e43256238dbfcf1fe37aac918a6d2d033e22d380","doi":"10.1038/NATURE14283","title":"Long-term decline of the Amazon carbon sink","authors":[{"LN":"Brienen","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Phillips","FN":"O."},{"LN":"Feldpausch","FN":"T."},{"LN":"Gloor","FN":"E."},{"LN":"Baker","FN":"T."},{"LN":"Lloyd","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Lopez-Gonzalez","FN":"G."},{"LN":"Monteagudo-Mendoza","FN":"A."},{"LN":"Malhi","FN":"Y."},{"LN":"Lewis","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Martinez","FN":"R.

Nevertheless, it is unclear how the terrestrial carbon sink will evolve as climate and atmospheric composition continue to change. Here we analyse the historical evolution of the biomass dynamics of the Amazon rainforest over three decades using a distributed network of 321 plots. While this analysis confirms that Amazon forests have acted as a long-term net biomass sink, we find a long-term decreasing trend of carbon accumulation. Rates of net increase in above-ground biomass declined by one-third during the past decade compared to the 1990s. This is a consequence of growth rate increases levelling off recently, while biomass mortality persistently increased throughout, leading to a shortening of carbon residence times. Potential drivers for the mortality increase include greater climate variability, and feedbacks of faster growth on mortality, resulting in shortened tree longevity. The observed decline of the Amazon sink diverges markedly from the recent increase in terrestrial carbon uptake at the global scale, and is contrary to expectations based on models."},{"id":"467f0fdc420f5cd8996c0b2b1eb33a3dcda93c5e","doi":"10.1126/SCIENCE.1244693","title":"High-Resolution Global Maps of 21st-Century Forest Cover Change","authors":[{"LN":"Hansen","FN":"M."},{"LN":"Potapov","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Moore","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Hancher","FN":"Matt"},{"LN":"Turubanova","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Tyukavina","FN":"A."},{"LN":"Thau","FN":"D."},{"LN":"Stehman","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Goetz","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Loveland","FN":"T."},{"LN":"Kommareddy","FN":"A."},{"LN":"Egorov","FN":"A."},{"LN":"Chini","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Justice","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Townshend","FN":"J."}],"year":2013,"journal":"Science","references":["04c3ca897f3806ebbb9b3182e93ca6db169b5cfe","0c74541b4dc1592a348dbc0f6dd9590bea657e15","248a2a41d8e0bdb93036bc780049cbc292059356","274f4b0bd389240ce9b729cadd21a10e9d672a32","283bf0d035420ec651ab4934f349b3d5e8a4b871","29b65b3e50d48961ccf5e4fbc833ba711cd36ec6","2d7745b2af0686586b3c3593e5344de60b5ce298","3203e7d2f0589a3cc934b50a218ebf888d5206c9","3b6dd340fb5442e0c31d73f40e241fdd73d42330","41eb932a84cf04a93c498539ad03d6f9dff11eed","4d26fcdc12504863140e64c149e3b9caa61cd303","50507705b84e262d953ee7131e81ced5042e1af9","5f1570e200b42e4cb1b9693fb9ada3aca1b6bf30","6effe4c910974f5245344b7685ffc8c563ca0dc4","76f8bf755abafbae81588f40372e67bd7487e122","77284ea470c9219ad16273dd384a224a534b0a11","7c11aba1413e988fb0905536b2edf0d5e42b6480","8017699564136f93af21575810d557dba1ee6fc6","8453dc1205b6d40dc9a70c51bfbb3ff590646d95","8827f8dfa77a15f5393ef7a543b148f3ed26a56f","8b2df498c994fa34691f45e42dd8faa2b44ed1ba","9c7623d015cb47012792dce79c3ceaa1fd78da23","9d094fd4cf1569f18b25b59bc0e697cc67ab0fee","acaf39ae2a9a32c3e771824f360540d33387fc45","b23546fc4728394e8614e616321fd8d22a0abb4c","b821f22dad1d754bef1179c9d2c546c4bb182b95","b95fda406779387c5342fd09efebc5d334584983","bdcb4c342db8f329483c5cb2dbbdebf549be0f80","cb7c961251f22700cc6f27466b36c22604196646","ce061d787499cacc5d30c0acaefd8ab417e3c5c6","d13af905a1eb321a6de9255433c66b0094dd28bc","d38a4ebc478672cf60a238b34fc9a75cc7972034","e7cbc158fb3e592d1821d8d351a55bc3da342404","e931e3f1a5cf05ceeb0e32f44ccd0c488689f80f","e935e8a022095f964d9e063a90b6da40372c836d","f26096f23a42d977be385f876c4ec4ecd079925e","f26fe7b69c9787f4e741f1788f719742fe645c39","f70785995b348fce5eed4686eb1407c75d455000",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":6655,"abstract":"Forests in Flux Forests worldwide are in a state of flux, with accelerating losses in some regions and gains in others. Hansen et al. (p. 850) examined global Landsat data at a 30-meter spatial resolution to characterize forest extent, loss, and gain from 2000 to 2012. Globally, 2.3 million square kilometers of forest were lost during the 12-year study period and 0.8 million square kilometers of new forest were gained. The tropics exhibited both the greatest losses and the greatest gains (through regrowth and plantation), with losses outstripping gains. Landsat data reveals details of forest losses and gains across the globe on an annual basis from 2000 to 2012. Quantification of global forest change has been lacking despite the recognized importance of forest ecosystem services. In this study, Earth observation satellite data were used to map global forest loss (2.3 million square kilometers) and gain (0.8 million square kilometers) from 2000 to 2012 at a spatial resolution of 30 meters. The tropics were the only climate domain to exhibit a trend, with forest loss increasing by 2101 square kilometers per year. Brazil’s well-documented reduction in deforestation was offset by increasing forest loss in Indonesia, Malaysia, Paraguay, Bolivia, Zambia, Angola, and elsewhere. Intensive forestry practiced within subtropical forests resulted in the highest rates of forest change globally. Boreal forest loss due largely to fire and forestry was second to that in the tropics in absolute and proportional terms.

Recent droughts caused greatly elevated fire-induced tree mortality in a fire experiment and widespread regional forest fires that burned 5–12% of southeastern Amazon forests. These results suggest that feedbacks between fires and extreme climatic conditions could increase the likelihood of an Amazon forest “dieback” in the near-term. To secure the integrity of seasonally dry Amazon forests, efforts to end deforestation must be accompanied by initiatives that reduce the accidental spread of land management fires into neighboring forest reserves and effectively suppress forest fires when they start. Interactions between climate and land-use change may drive widespread degradation of Amazonian forests. High-intensity fires associated with extreme weather events could accelerate this degradation by abruptly increasing tree mortality, but this process remains poorly understood. Here we present, to our knowledge, the first field-based evidence of a tipping point in Amazon forests due to altered fire regimes. Based on results of a large-scale, long-term experiment with annual and triennial burn regimes (B1yr and B3yr, respectively) in the Amazon, we found abrupt increases in fire-induced tree mortality (226 and 462%) during a severe drought event, when fuel loads and air temperatures were substantially higher and relative humidity was lower than long-term averages. This threshold mortality response had a cascading effect, causing sharp declines in canopy cover (23 and 31%) and aboveground live biomass (12 and 30%) and favoring widespread invasion by flammable grasses across the forest edge area (80 and 63%), where fires were most intense (e.g., 220 and 820 kW⋅m−1). During the droughts of 2007 and 2010, regional forest fires burned 12 and 5% of southeastern Amazon forests, respectively, compared with <1% in nondrought years. These results show that a few extreme drought events, coupled with forest fragmentation and anthropogenic ignition sources, are already causing widespread fire-induced tree mortality and forest degradation across southeastern Amazon forests. Future projections of vegetation responses to climate change across drier portions of the Amazon require more than simulation of global climate forcing alone and must also include interactions of extreme weather events, fire, and land-use change."},{"id":"df6ade47d3bbab757e8fcf6b3f026b7d3d44ed01","doi":"10.1111/J.1365-2486.2008.01626.X","title":"Evaluation of the terrestrial carbon cycle,

study tests the ability of five Dynamic Global Vegetation Models (DGVMs), forced with observed climatology and atmospheric CO2, to model the contemporary global carbon cycle. The DGVMs are also coupled to a fast ‘climate analogue model’, based on the Hadley Centre General Circulation Model (GCM), and run into the future for four Special Report Emission Scenarios (SRES): A1FI, A2, B1, B2. Results show that all DGVMs are consistent with the contemporary global land carbon budget. Under the more extreme projections of future environmental change, the responses of the DGVMs diverge markedly. In particular, large uncertainties are associated with the response of tropical vegetation to drought and boreal ecosystems to elevated temperatures and changing soil moisture status. The DGVMs show more divergence in their response to regional changes in climate than to increases in atmospheric CO2 content. All models simulate a release of land carbon in response to climate, when physiological effects of elevated atmospheric CO2 on plant production are not considered, implying a positive terrestrial climate-carbon cycle feedback. All DGVMs simulate a reduction in global net primary production (NPP) and a decrease in soil residence time in the tropics and extra-tropics in response to future climate. When both counteracting effects of climate and atmospheric CO2 on ecosystem function are considered, all the DGVMs simulate cumulative net land carbon uptake over the 21st century for the four SRES emission scenarios. However, for the most extreme A1FI emissions scenario, three out of five DGVMs simulate an annual net source of CO2 from the land to the atmosphere in the final decades of the 21st century. For this scenario, cumulative land uptake differs by 494 Pg C among DGVMs over the 21st century. This uncertainty is equivalent to over 50 years of anthropogenic emissions at current levels."},{"id":"2b0dd59254ed9d1255f817e427ede2c9f53e5e5f","doi":"10.1146/ANNUREV.ENERGY.28.050302.105532","title":"Global State of Biodiversity and Loss","authors":[{"LN":"Dirzo","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Raven","FN":"P."}],"year":2003,"journal":"","references":["0236e6bc9b8e7d3986b1925416c64769df90220a","080f7b49703eac4212ea9a3a0f362bb503cf0ac4","09cd71b29d32e0f891fdd6ea022fddb2deb98b4d","0c102887261c13a69086743942c37ff651882314","1026af38a4087858fdc86c5d2295eca031012c39","112419451ffc950b6960400625cef07b2b4bb69c","14a8e00d26951a97850e87127e4d0daa7275d7f1","169df12bcba2fe44d8e41c3fdc885944a7e24afa","1eafe092a6845b07323ced13d09c09e5468997f0","1ffe0ed6cee22ffd00d017077a0ef50b22f44a02","1fff3ac81629f3a1d14e19fd97dfe1c36cc7a3ef","2577c28b9b1a09950a6fff7e6af6e9b918ad7042","26d24614611fa00f3f0efb7a6c8b277e5744a2df","2fe14a4437b349d744b1d375836ebc7b44395840","313da42446962e9455aef1f5cabfe2ca9e54f108","33a47f40cdd85efec9dc8ade98fa174fc1979e20","35e3a767f431a786a80f8e21e3d503257f37390b","46df18bed9e9f08dfc3b0769ac2edd36f46668af","4baa4527e3ca31980b0458cd0ef829b02562f24f","4c19140912abe1ead0449104c44ac13d53107622","59ff863ecaa090b9de6b0546ffc9b9a96a23381b","5a01fb2208c1f7aa95a6ea01398914ab5196d8b4","5aa1b6f7522739c34c2969a36ed8e749af0e2ff0","5ae37fd8df5ea78105e02d7c60890e8101d67804","61143d56fdb95167064d3c57f1619e18ee644207","65b34df8a99723763aeec26868f0494c471bfa3b","65e4451fde6ed7d76d881edcc9e5f79867630bee","6736ae8ac75816d07f48747df58937fa88eae70f","7485778e9dab7b26a8514b51db9b24f91dda8fc7","761f226d47dffce5ff959ae13fe4ca217da3ed24","7d50ded3e283b23d24f1a1c7f38e34ef639074c9","7eb3285c75e6cacc53f353d64e5df6019a3059b0","7f5d39006b47fcb71035fba80c925ce510a39fd5","806a3b704880c60c2201ec47f66d968a5ecdca7a","824f5d2e6ff2be23914701a2f67672bb9ff8e8d0","842707dc3181d936a8ef1f1759735c2d09d549ec","8d1b2ac6e9c5f2117a6a66d9b1514a96e204b0d6","8f5feeecbcbcb63379911933055e34711825cb9e","9b39304753968279531ce40cab74a7c76d675cd7","9e26c1774ed9d8699e5922cc93ad5d522ea3dd19","a1a63a8c0a7b10325fa0b99a09d4dabdacf88b23","a6dca2fa5eb8fd9012cdea9eb72c001df2c1c013","a72a642be9003312f40ca09824319530bdd38744","a86d9f01a7240ab9c0bf432979d0a9665fe900af","a9d1e247dfe2bd7acb3fcbbd7e856e1fda8697a7","aace570f26bc587f5e8cbe2aaf4539fa2f58932a","af21dc924771dcf6da8abcee23bb892437544e5a","b6178a5917c3d05f7eb15304528960efc83b13e5","b6222d5b02c2f2a98c349df885f7ecdb4f17c07d","b8d4198aafc37b298bd71ef0517bd64dba380fe2","bb0274d80d0c8f9d8fcc2827586e414e37ab05e1","beab115c13106fe7a2e2f2b0a7a1b648a0ca757b","bf492955133fb500d9504546b59d79c145ee7d7d","c1c303c5a650e277ae282a529b67042fded4c72d","c84251ece03c721c630c0aff431dd16ad57b88fe","c98f543d051d2f96791aeb411d5d3f7321366a86","cc989790c2b4a58b5418408163558138be8fcd87","db2b2daad34f35997b2cf78575d82cb8043c7921","e056b7f266f0ec403c5be82432dbbcd467028732","e2e299c708a72d3100663ff7029252397ca90ed1","e415038575b84918414f8973acff6a399a8b66f2","e7b00ca10b9400cb206c3b04942b80ca2e8566d3","f3dc87718d9cd31bb66e59c928c0a20ccce794ef","f44be8ee5012a20eb6cf1e01c2c04ad376c5990b","fe47443775523da3e7eed8afb5db15d329ac36a3",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":1072,"abstract":"▪ Abstract Biodiversity, a central component of Earth's life support systems, is directly relevant to human societies. We examine the dimensions and nature of the Earth's terrestrial biodiversity and review the scientific facts concerning the rate of loss of biodiversity and the drivers of this loss. The estimate for the total number of species of eukaryotic organisms possible lies in the 5–15 million range, with a best guess of ∼7 million. Species diversity is unevenly distributed; the highest concentrations are in tropical ecosystems. Endemisms are concentrated in a few hotspots, which are in turn seriously threatened by habitat destruction—the most prominent driver of biodiversity loss. For the past 300 years, recorded extinctions for a few groups of organisms reveal rates of extinction at least several hundred times the rate expected on the basis of the geological record. The loss of biodiversity is the only truly irreversible global environmental change the Earth faces today."},{"id":"4e16328e599e9d3169f40b6dbfbd039b4ca673a2","doi":"10.1073/PNAS.0811729106","title":"Turning back from the brink: Detecting an impending regime shift in time to avert it","authors":[{"LN":"Biggs","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Carpenter","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Brock","FN":"W."}],"year":2009,"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","references":["0043cf9ba569181bd72305fa6989e22dd352c6b8","0a85b4c691d0284e0709362ffba3d0df8b4f9309","0befd876c7219512edc1f43496432e946ac291d7","14e3aba60e40609d6c7914ee6c15cd35e61b1701","22bf6bccf7da09e60943040beebcdb2f2a0ff840","28d99854c7e9f174ce3188f4a5d62c05df4c7e1a","2a3c1d2ea24b689371ff1c9b31599d12bfc04689","2c15962f29fee1b4ddb3c98e6bfca874b1b3d1f8","35c99c1d463bf1206c6864a3edc617368c4b18a8","39090b7c4ef7857105b63c7fa5cc6653e1f107a9","39d7af0b26d50f78d9cd2a41b1ccceccd1c1f339","4456fe33456b122e3b1aa264d8a269d078c414f9","4638f8624e610e5a5b3be998825e2d7b803a1c85","4974cd741eb8a6c437a54d75ae2df2550c65c391","4d41108590a7823ea9b943bd4c614534edba3b8d","527bce4f3dce90cd048c918a9e10d14709dbbb5e","62a3154648d830e4ca1d22b45e530c8a184f35ad","64701c98e1187d9a221e7b2f6557d25cb0cc0926","66ece56fad0abf74bc3d4299caff0399fc6ee926","69f5295261f78b9aecfdc5193e256652f62b6fff","73da6ea7c5e4b63536ee537412a5942ccf3b394a","764163bbc58ef90d65799c77233fb89a012fcb0b","78470b48746486ce13b05bcc067abe5b6fbf6cf9","7b795e7ef9e1f5e3abbf22523d743ba0ee8ee4f9","7be1503a792568ba35e9ba65a6a98876dc2bc808","829aef450e50dcb10760049d2698f1bd60b3a926","833133de92889e4b2efb212354e499b801112296","8488b9d69fa47093b6cf77562473d0333ece1896","8c2257a33be30bdc440318b1ef142ef9b5555560","8cdb2602ae7a6ee7584b58ceb43fdfcf7164abdf","8f8d2d73883cac979bb9b9c1809e7ccde8851ecf","929d721d97a90b4b8436b7baa21d138a8666bebd","9aec799a38d5b8e73804aa5696dde35406071f8a","a0627f0a8e4d70e4dc4c2cf9290218bc80bc4c87","a41e5439ef56530976852d8de4f07deb1714e218","a6effb81dd96caaeeae2d133351a1d8267851e88","aa48da626fee81cec1b94d5292692a6c8e342def","b37de9da1210027f6314a410c3cacde8cb8aaad8","b6d7e6a2763da443c3386edfe70bf46c07059da1","c2a8c3de259cc8b1b7aeda2631032424f9d11020","c831ce06c4f53ff320ed40bfab9b12c3b8ca9b79","ce09069d25ff87618deb80b11fce1c594e0a8dcb","d01bb612a81eff7e78905ac67ed59f8a1eb56793","d0efe955add21f09e759de27d10cbb54f9c5b149","d60cc133eb0ffa32deab3f06392abf5ea7485409","db988a848dd93c7916b550ad26d3133ad8406433","e14fec7739c1795ef499e55e5d3c74cc90d18da9","e3c689fee7fcbb7e5c0c7732b9d537bd1d3a8e4a","e86fd30425407b651f6644629faf4b68140abd1c","ecb5e70f020caa55de89da0738301e506ebb529f","eceeecc81431c44791723346cc283419c0606f98","faa8d78e3cbb1f1e814a2808c56f8d08f0a06c74","fd54d6d3be16b0e4515038f7e64ca950b7d24fdc","fdd00ce30321fcbb2adf4333878ad5fb3c76b7c6",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":600,"abstract":"Ecological regime shifts are large, abrupt, long-lasting changes in ecosystems that often have considerable impacts on human economies and societies. Avoiding unintentional regime shifts is widely regarded as desirable, but prediction of ecological regime shifts is notoriously difficult. Recent research indicates that changes in ecological time series (e.g., increased variability and autocorrelation) could potentially serve as early warning indicators of impending shifts. A critical question, however, is whether such indicators provide sufficient warning to adapt management to avert regime shifts. We examine this question using a fisheries model, with regime shifts driven by angling (amenable to rapid reduction) or shoreline development (only gradual restoration is possible). The model represents key features of a broad class of ecological regime shifts. We find that if drivers can only be manipulated gradually management action is needed substantially before a regime shift to avert it; if drivers can be rapidly altered aversive action may be delayed until a shift is underway. Large increases in the indicators only occur once a regime shift is initiated, often too late for management to avert a shift. To improve usefulness in averting regime shifts, we suggest that research focus on defining critical indicator levels rather than detecting change in the indicators. Ideally, critical indicator levels should be related to switches in ecosystem attractors; we present a new spectral density ratio indicator to this end. Averting ecological regime shifts is also dependent on developing policy processes that enable society to respond more rapidly to information about impending regime shifts."},{"id":"68e014afbe6940b43981f8a572e3d995a4a95240","doi":"10.1038/S41598-017-05373-2","title":"Unprecedented drought over tropical South America in 2016: significantly under-predicted by tropical SST","authors":[{"LN":"Erfanian","FN":"A."},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Guiling"},{"LN":"Fomenko","FN":"Lori"}],"year":2017,"journal":"Scientific Reports","references":["090256bdc67eace0034cdc673595803cede39617","12771dd7bbcfc1d025aa4e6379bbf6a31cb51d18","17680fd853f379a1222809fd3b0a914ea034323d","1b42be4c685d3b79d4ccb661d218a6db6080959a","1dc886ac2f208422112e7670647c99b5e22966ed","1f9ed16d4b5f8fcd27fc0501582d76afc07835b2","23575b81ad2e270a6d5223cd7eba4da84dca10a0","23d6b0a9d02702553122fb8a7c2a9c81e23089d4","36e95441731e8bd2996458f9c52d14b276d03237","38922aea90e9bde78f6a30eda949f25243ef2bb1","4097d1d38c786f89b895eb17daaf2de1d1a79b14","4741f3604f603cc98c3355e03bf18237cc521187","47e9ab57e88f51afefd34c7b6f07b7c4dbe9216f","4985e7bd487f421b3e700595ee8f36967e07e54f","4a14dde9a07dd2b5e07a7fa338a11db8035a2555","4affb585b69ede1a4e95cf027165494568dbd60d","4d322876371e3d284b9fa663f205c0dcbb98d5c7","605d4ae02692e6808b2180007a5ddfbc810aa8b9","65989ad6a285e94fce9a180d82266a9e1c51dc1e","683fc4a3d38cc042e22ee0eb433807f760643b12","6b1a0a48e3f963b25c5670df9324a4470062b41c","6c6adb36f5c921322a5a967f204f08f33f1ced2e","706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","729b0e3e8f37ec760947a2be926e7345cb73b2d3","84187be36080530e684da905f43e562ed8bb37f8","86709de905bb8ff61c528d2c6de3c0e84e2a00c3","8a751c91d39b9acaaa8d70d2dabe038febce17f5","8bed7999db395257ab756449fd8f1dddf6076636","8c87d30489bd5cfb8d72148337cc5dfee1670553","8eae17d86e6366f535382447172dfdc2b2c97bc8","8f091488e087aff5dc997d0ad71a79bf65fbf2a2","90b1b2af1227ad635d427b68f70f632069ddbe23","94fa8cf405d8e08cbf7927a9db01b2fdf8f52e78","9603ebbd0b60ffac3fc1e86197abfb1b50a91eca","966fb4493350dfd24197f596084ae7ea87017847","9bdf8afa76c1a7fbbc0fd58e7d6abcaa2817785e","a010b76e1a809da5a128def075a310b1b1511593","a2ffe92732622c4a7321dade663b03f0dc0d998c","aa04cf9732a972bc9f489db67ed7741987f0f025","ab7628b80f923ccd721d8057d0ae424dbadd1362","abfcd9139be4a4505902fb787adab7b686365c1f","acc59a30d83ff1a9b64e0ab38918baf635b1891d","ad291bd5b21860267afd7c5a1fc6d44148de71cf","b40f6f5f1f5931a2f902da254405c554e3ca6b9c","bf52f9d48ee4161d362628f8c0e476618577280c","c1faae306088d295b4fe1ca4811a0366cadb3ada","c3f7136d6cb726b295eb34565a8270177c57f40f","c94db9886d258a24e0239646a0f090abba253386","d2d1c5b6db0a49162e26cbe3681aba5746dac515","d91b77ac6ad3b89a1c4d6f15f4e6a7922b83dc44","da62f90cd880886d5a87e6e2454e1a6547f95739","e317820eff7bf69a4989edec5054dc541e88d77d","eb26fe7b235539442fa70524e90fd79ad44c2372","ff77d554e4174900682f17e13834b1a56052fb81",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":106,"abstract":"Tropical and sub-tropical South America are highly susceptible to extreme droughts. Recent events include two droughts (2005 and 2010) exceeding the 100-year return value in the Amazon and recurrent extreme droughts in the Nordeste region, with profound eco-hydrological and socioeconomic impacts. In 2015–2016, both regions were hit by another drought. Here, we show that the severity of the 2015–2016 drought (\"2016 drought\" hereafter) is unprecedented based on multiple precipitation products (since 1900), satellite-derived data on terrestrial water storage (since 2002) and two vegetation indices (since 2004). The ecohydrological consequences from the 2016 drought are more severe and extensive than the 2005 and 2010 droughts. Empirical relationships between rainfall and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the tropical Pacific and Atlantic are used to assess the role of tropical oceanic variability in the observed precipitation anomalies. Our results indicate that warmer-than-usual SSTs in the Tropical Pacific (including El Niño events) and Atlantic were the main drivers of extreme droughts in South America, but are unable to explain the severity of the 2016 observed rainfall deficits for a substantial portion of the Amazonia and Nordeste regions. This strongly suggests potential contribution of non-oceanic factors (e.g., land cover change and CO2-induced warming) to the 2016 drought."},{"id":"9758a5cb826ed7199ee8822f08108fd6bbf7a106","doi":"10.1038/NCLIMATE1143","title":"Early warning of climate tipping points","authors":[{"LN":"Lenton","FN":"T."}],"year":2011,"journal":"","references":["0fd0794e2ae77a48bd41d74cd376b33af18f06d6","106b053655aadc3e0beeaf21619956b192cd23bc","1d4c18e039312368a7cf2a4861292c7f6e515989","201eed96b494d969b6b18c258b7edbe0e8693f96","27877e99704cd5fc26b5b2bc6f9533c58cbac230","2d7745b2af0686586b3c3593e5344de60b5ce298","2df53c97b0d7f3bebf5e9091d784ea99206c5ac5","314938da2de86a7d561bff418c9988e1d1065134","38567041cf6e042718b528f854bff35589c439b1","43cb69c03b940a603f82e6db72fb5eefaea863de","4550ec4ae20cb7bd3bf3b647ac65a93da033d465","467f417293298a45126f4df8aa98e0a72821dcb6","4babd12194393fd74af2f8007dbc74e53c996fb2","4c081113ddadbb316dfe654cfc0a330d25ff0722","4dfe2db0a24fd7d9ebb59da4200248015dde6118","4e16328e599e9d3169f40b6dbfbd039b4ca673a2","52ea1dbbee7245873c95d0855b1ad0d3b0c7d70e","534f55b49080a1fbd63ad90967f7696d1a3eb0d5","53564c45fe0af4889c92f05b04626f7ac739a97a","54bd43dbedb83689950fc9d640d803a6353b3400","5708577dce9595874cad66254277596e3dc6f710","59a0dd6f40fbcbf012f236fe51edc6d7f13c5fb9","59a435f5e122fd959b0d97b3452465983ebf9cc9","5ae178876f6ef4cb6baa5ab76d22d8e3f5c6a96b","5d7f407e14d997b4fde8883139bb8aadf414ee74","62930f8cf0c78b5276fa7bd1dd6f6e3fa48b3d68","66ece56fad0abf74bc3d4299caff0399fc6ee926","67abed497e78161d0cc3080650c2ffa2f2cd7b25","6a54c0791e97836fb98a8abffda4974af5a66229","6cdbe2f3f8e19b9b4fc5e3b623420d25df9496c0","6d823e6faf0b1c46ee5b597afc5da9572c0c0350","6e93fbb3d843fafca46c527eb78f3b226e306c12","6ef5f14bee23e150535bbc780b5ad0066ad7021d","6f321d5ceecc733d061e4d35517f374bce6d055d","70fae121f412c19612115eff06c13134b8cb2060","7970a03704dac9dde4918fad3692a5f5c473743d","7b11e8135584aeb40c5af839b9142280f117cc15","7ba6a893226810aefa58479494938b2f18333504","7bc019d3bf9b9ecc293c6e97b1b76055ced6692d","7be1503a792568ba35e9ba65a6a98876dc2bc808","7cbba074ef4090e8e3c2c09b3c65751ea4f4ab69","7de54aaa226118843706796adf8840eae1c81bee","8004847c2995e26d04229a40d4c18c92647bb74b","8020fefd752e8d51f5c7ab570693a2aabe05e5a9","83a1d6d6e5d8478337578fd83bd70227487c5e60","8867b780c14d6093a5a2d9b39b5f0ad859154917","89c583a90b73571c7b3bae62e7547326faddf050","8c2257a33be30bdc440318b1ef142ef9b5555560","8d826f5145a86be76861aefd36114598c023e20c","8f44d70d03f575e70f519ab5e60e5433129de9ed","8f8d2d73883cac979bb9b9c1809e7ccde8851ecf","98482a00da32672f7b21206336df41324d3a1e6f","9ae6623c0cec2832a8c9b6def85655c48becad6c","9bf4d6c33906d1edb22ee87a4511ddef8e64e508","a0c1d2929b401b0d479d807ee3c37cfae6d23c41","a30e5ae03a1600260274d1b9b7eb3e2449b8fdf6","a3461eaf51016f9d6e85ea47173b27e019e801c4","a3aecac5c83d7fda2205bfb62e3367c1fc42e997","a6bc4a16d203b6c7c69fc7420eaf13fa59a8218c","ad24decfa4dda9fe94dbaa6ebd77f08b699ddc77","b525e60c5a3dc97f8ba7c07bf30c7fabb447db3f","b6d8c44ecc88749cb407be51fe5ea6e5e867938c","b876ac7ce144c170afc5e60636eaf2aff4fb8a6a","bbb6bac21661560748b88700e714342212ab174b","be3eda717b99731f93de80d75031f38e40f84cee","bf4954e8d20db02b4d5deea875b888f0c64f0b37","c2a8c3de259cc8b1b7aeda2631032424f9d11020","c5925f0d115c94963d2fa38177f1558067264196","c61db0f345460036c0ac8482cf006d20f808302d","c6544f260424c24d991c557a1ed8c426c57f5834","c6fb49b279bc022f34fb10994b23e667569e9780","c9f9b63b9a213f516fa0330d1afe7c046b36037b","cfbb2b4d2da12e1fe93bd2e7d1d3b5f22acc884b","d06649ac0e9f72a0bd556ef69d81ce70ba668499","d37be508b1b8576e97ea1a51ecba0a9dbc5bbee5","d7aa74690ce0bb9317236b7035df4042419509c7","dce4691783cbf0859c0cf908d9a3eee863ac69ad","dd5f267df08d7b81b29fa445106b867f38cd7819","e28055fa32c854d1eb89190a91b31cf721129095","e3711b7734eb8371510f81e4cfa696cc714f3324","e52ec6bb551a95d2560dc011b2a3a22dd6d1803f","ea0f518e9e6873d1fd2c9342baf8720147e3b5c3","ed01afa3bb9ae5b24dadca49bc6878707231a8a2","eeea9c95333f27a515d903eebf664ed073c2bd48","ef5f590f6cbfcfaf48518ee6f5de9f8266f803df","fc84f164036528a29b4d7c296471453d52352710",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":572,"abstract":"A tipping point occurs when an external forcing causes a qualitative change in a system.

Recently, it has been proposed that such loss of resilience may be detected from elevated autocorrelation and variance in the fluctuations of the state of an ecosystem due to critical slowing down; the underlying generic phenomenon that occurs at critical thresholds. Here we explore the robustness of autocorrelation and variance as indicators of imminent critical transitions. We show both analytically and in simulations that variance may sometimes decrease close to a transition. This can happen when environmental factors fluctuate stochastically and the ecosystem becomes less sensitive to these factors near the threshold, or when critical slowing down reduces the ecosystem's capacity to follow high-frequency fluctuations in the environment. In addition, when available data is limited, variance can be systematically underestimated due to the prevalence of low frequencies close to a transition. By contrast, autocorrelation always increases toward critical transitions in our analyses. To exemplify this point, we provide cases of rising autocorrelation and increasing or decreasing variance in time series prior to past climate transitions."},{"id":"0de477d496b226525e56d2e6591a7721697dc2a8","doi":"10.1111/J.1461-0248.2010.01497.X","title":"Testing for criticality in ecosystem dynamics: the case of Amazonian rainforest and savanna fire.","authors":[{"LN":"Pueyo","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Graça","FN":"Paulo Maurício Lima de Alencastro"},{"LN":"Barbosa","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Cots","FN":"Ricard"},{"LN":"Cardona","FN":"Eva"},{"LN":"Fearnside","FN":"P."}],"year":2010,"journal":"Ecology letters","references":["11bd55ed3a322632ced52685a852d472a9f6e38d","17680fd853f379a1222809fd3b0a914ea034323d","185ef4ef54edaccad557300d90bdba86ccca2c57","23895f7b99920874245b3c9d1dffdb0ca887de49","29e0b01bab1c7cea2a91f55ff0624162654ef127","2dca50bbef9ff3e6df23510c3a1c4c60f4b83395","3118d7cc41ba8129669d8e814357e2dec29403b8","33ec99b52e61504db53409c519475704f53a4ccc","42f93dad279f0d38594d6269f475ec1e415dbbdf","44f55aca8f24dca171623ad258a8523950e804c0","45207c1ba2f0d32077bcb054e0ab9dc43c58440f","4a31feb8468936a9bb3246196bcff5a3bc2d0c99","4db4a220e3782c7d6c5c2a044e8cfb7c9c41c91c","57f990c3ba70ab8fbb913a99a3f8d5b5460f62a6","597df832af7b0feca25f7958ecd9fa29330927ac","5c8fb4bb09d93de0e424cb050728a3f6338d12cc","64c97599c8a85de6086fa15d18a176ad0280c18d","6ca3a4928c5a2fe1729ae3fc4da9aa97e1496078","7b00b0c04b9fb3ebf683bede912313ab13be15ae","7f69fbacfaea11f8f92bfc320efbf98299fd9997","817e7f9fe9850de042c446ffda1e6901ea431543","81a78edc8f521cb818b3a2f8c87eba68ae3ad5b0","823890b7f81fe26ce626324a0f9b9abeffcf1bc3","82f2f59ff69493da9c238299228907e157058c06","88563ee5a763a2d64fe8cd0f72e3ef0f4b96e174","8c26253859db5b96642389b0e51be869f6eb5723","9489a3258843a7f8798fc9da3eeb7778a2f46d8b","9b5f30bb12f2de73219252330fc14049b8ecdd5e","9cefc7a491817b22f0998effb00b7e51c80eed0b","9d92257a8ea4c5ea1c9ff456269eeb8392b981ab","a2432796472c2352fe7cac9fbea51c2c1c824b27","a462ff18ab1e2ae7c526b89a479dbbec4addee9f","a637f09be32f8ff15cf16b60321aaa74cb208ac1","a6dba705b97fa5345374bd275ca5b08498f174f1","aa718ee17abc77e5c172d3eac6a8ffe893f2b66f","ac8bd1fee9eec89a0bee1fbf0b63ec15abc08f67","b0cc7cc671c6b4d251d480a3dda2eb3ba79e8db1","b767ad0f4799b74b81c3ecb3214dd5dcc7b6395a","bbc82e3e59a59a20e8d01d08f4cccba7c7b77c50","be3eda717b99731f93de80d75031f38e40f84cee","bfa49738628057730248cf1f946503e9ad3e57f6","c5d995f71bfeadec62a93729f1f3cf980c4d8cb8","ca28d2aafa1cd8a67647b0bee0e7d9ad12d0a24b","d5eedf8ce72e5835a46e13116d1d998ca8ee5766","da6ba44c43e1f450028e2958e1371a9dabd7e3a3","dbb4a92166ef11e25f929377d167f4f021040efd","f191efb8adb14233c47a402788b0040b53176efc","f553a49e6daf9c31f33c4406eacdb349ac6989ed","f8ad4bd7ef89a71c81f4ccf89d23f64a3d9018c8","fbfb5fb4646201931a819cb96a7b7971a45de5ca","fe645e9c4d75bda4386f7ef455126d7763ba7ad5",null,null],"citationsCount":74,"abstract":"We test for two critical phenomena in Amazonian ecosystems: self-organized criticality (SOC) and critical transitions. SOC is often presented in the complex systems literature as a general explanation for scale invariance in nature. In particular, this mechanism is claimed to underlie the macroscopic structure and dynamics of terrestrial ecosystems. These would be inextricably linked to the action of fire, which is conceived as an endogenous ecological process. We show that Amazonian savanna fires display the scale-invariant features characteristic of SOC but do not display SOC. The same is true in Amazonian rainforests subject to moderate drought. These findings prove that there are other causes of scale invariance in ecosystems. In contrast, we do find evidence of a critical transition to a megafire regime under extreme drought in rainforests; this phenomenon is likely to determine the time scale of a possible loss of Amazonian rainforest caused by climate change."},{"id":"12334afe89c06c07a1409d4442a1d51c26e10d93","doi":"10.1038/SREP41489","title":"A deforestation-induced tipping point for the South American monsoon system","authors":[{"LN":"Boers","FN":"N."},{"LN":"Marwan","FN":"N."},{"LN":"Barbosa","FN":"H."},{"LN":"Kurths","FN":"J."}],"year":2017,"journal":"Scientific reports","references":["0707bb3c3139e9d3ddc1e9cb37aeb19436c76ed1","0d2e37b70ed6158a797fbd5bac2d8d4880654445","0ecd0480dd501d58ce24096735e0e53f7056ceb0","119653e133fdd0dde2b27aeb372fd076a3b7baea","1b19fb3bc538ff8f5e407be09af7b06459aae5e3","201b76815c9efc63b534b3c20c23423b72b6ec4f","26b854bb1e882df989244e34ac45cd239eb9ade9","2ad4125a68b7244277be6b85687f1a421908f40f","2af68a82823c0523ae52b1943e75bd5b95d1ead3","31693c9b7960774808dc32ff6a825d264b2dd34f","31c2cd31d32181c8972e536497c82bdc39e66ff9","351625f66dfe426c0515d216d34da8fd9b7b2d09","354f931b92a51180bbeaf49f89d662ee7984ab50","412a0bb5a3baa91b62053d82c562bc172df0439f","420363c5c820126fc9b6fef75a05c366d92aa9ee","56a283e05e80aac325b2cf78245147e68f6ed1e3","64bc8bff8435ba1f23d340c25491bef364acd850","6569487a629fd8a3ae7f145a7219dd997f105b92","6e604804edaccd7b7e6665f95490dc34ad058cd9","7b98938971780de214ee8b48a629751bae076aa0","8a331f5a3e5ee466fd8920ab57f3b08f67cf2843","96a630a6cd9049bd66593c88b8ceb52675192ef7","987fc140593dfa3e3990b0702be40f706989eed4","98f360039931313392890a96c616c1ff75b3ae43","a010b76e1a809da5a128def075a310b1b1511593","a637f09be32f8ff15cf16b60321aaa74cb208ac1","a761cae590065a9322c85e552efe3ebe882731ac","a8efde89aa4a97ae951a797f55ae8483701d2f6f","b0cc7cc671c6b4d251d480a3dda2eb3ba79e8db1","b5f9947d51d35db12c54d9199867f760397d4455","bdc1b8a85dcb50ddf7333421f27455203703ba19","c331d747d84ce490920400a352fa3eeecafc4a7f","c38261102326bace677760db08a86fa5a430f9e4","cd208243adede122cc89357261d715fea17f607b","d0022a2fb41caa9b45bd87d95b8e34269de03c15","d2d1c5b6db0a49162e26cbe3681aba5746dac515","e1b4aab9a6dfebaba658642f527084e2d0f53dbb","e63134776135091eed4b3fa134d8eeb891a866b2","e984bab85db8cafdc298370252dc4daa8f71f1fa",null,null,null],"citationsCount":137,"abstract":"The Amazon rainforest has been proposed as a tipping element of the earth system, with the possibility of a dieback of the entire ecosystem due to deforestation only of parts of the rainforest. Possible physical mechanisms behind such a transition are still subject to ongoing debates. Here, we use a specifically designed model to analyse the nonlinear couplings between the Amazon rainforest and the atmospheric moisture transport from the Atlantic to the South American continent. These couplings are associated with a westward cascade of precipitation and evapotranspiration across the Amazon. We investigate impacts of deforestation on the South American monsoonal circulation with particular focus on a previously neglected positive feedback related to condensational latent heating over the rainforest, which strongly enhances atmospheric moisture inflow from the Atlantic. Our results indicate the existence of a tipping point. In our model setup, crossing the tipping point causes precipitation reductions of up to 40% in non-deforested parts of the western Amazon and regions further downstream. The responsible mechanism is the breakdown of the aforementioned feedback, which occurs when deforestation reduces transpiration to a point where the available atmospheric moisture does not suffice anymore to release the latent heat needed to maintain the feedback."},{"id":"7411530aa26843b62f9174fa9d004bab72e476dc","doi":"10.1029/2002JD002670","title":"Global analyses of sea surface temperature, sea ice, and night marine air temperature since the late nineteenth century","authors":[{"LN":"Rayner","FN":"N."},{"LN":"Parker","FN":"D."},{"LN":"Horton","FN":"E."},{"LN":"Folland","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Alexander","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Rowell","FN":"D."},{"LN":"Kent","FN":"Elizabeth C."},{"LN":"Kaplan","FN":"A."}],"year":2003,"journal":"","references":["01c11ec82a1b56ee16dfb467083980d9b9d07845","021c8120f46c30dbe125766277f9e215776adbd5","03c6b53aaee810f6acc111787ee6f4496fb0835b","05238537ac024fe9b15ee524b08bec3fcfea8618","091a73473d335fa00f8c3b0a3f50ac8212c0d7c0","0a8882a78792cfeb3d07832236e50b2e8e8ccf18","0c55f9cb9167805b07f6a47cac90dfe6f76eda0f","0f2dbb867c3613f6bc2e099e8971af191040aed6","120f7d48d166d2462bfff0c6ede8f4b6766c0698","1267ea5b3462e1e8e6941e0f2026d0b0ff9825ed","13a630d49a815e3b518b75636bacb51fccef22e1","17a18868284526d0b5f232e9c1897ee5b9cc0c60","18e957e51c1d42817afd929b08594ccf68a6cb05","1e1addd01e769a0a42888f3dcc1a66bceb54aae1","2174a398f9114b7694760775603087ca8daaa413","257d53c3c74b3af35a6473a0496f2c671e10df63","28c95023b4c6319f5d535aec36ce3c4de5c22a42","295908215a6ed8a8aeb3d7571e03b5903ea1dc35","2a32bdc04850e9ea79974979d6fad1f75c182ffe","31325f310519640ecc4bafe302e65384767a99f1","316d262415efc1d355bae868dfd2dcce8ef61524","34fa0ae0a8b1949eda8902fc28d331b3a7bb90d5","371f9cee95a4771c251e65dbf0cdc00a9be1cd6c","3ba5f1a41d284c9efe344df0d068e052b50db2d2","3d4e6c1a04faec4ac1e24288d51f796a8c59f487","3ebbd2c44c22d7dc9989dfd73e34c9a8063423f8","46e93763dee97d868b20a9cdda9c4410a24b4b0f","47d38a1b253a5e0ad24ab64549229803c2541afd","4f14d0e480cd6cf4ee70cd97ac14e6db132d25e4","51c52e315cda68158fa5328037d5ff8f67d96fa9","5463fb2a50f6e01c52ddb438bc179bfe96ddb0fe","554acf18f3865d9024e0038b058bcde85521dc45","57f1f5f3917ad385f77eb12d53e41d0e7655c471","5856fab9a89bf12156b2190ba5403cfac7796fad","58d617075b07647bebbb9af89221b59c4b5da855","5990f4f4d11c49c31e080086b903e3ece9048113","59f632f3389590c3901dad6eafb755cc72156b51","5a87617d0acf59ae487bfd5d89d8c14006d67010","5b5801b4c1ab98061c09fb0024384333d4c13668","5c5815ee30de74bb6cab1cc7bfb5d991b093cb3b","6619f1f7827a84fb869ffcabfaa66d15e3332e4d","714bc5caadbdfd361e5213b3d48ca49b1ab95806","73bcaa3b579d3abc7a4fc165bbeeac76ceef8ae9","774e8d544542686c58c1be0ab913a070246d815a","779839d50c48ecf05c31c642ee1aa2d5c986c4ad","818a1a393eb9b02fa32937234fd4f84223ba8154","8610295b58473bb7c048cba7ec265fb6ca5557b4","8838cc9d7218a10c482f3844259d720441d9e19a","90cbc9d5d8b529cb84697b66d7e26e7d7daf9401","926f7d451ff1820200fe3e030ddcaa9ec838bcad","97cc989d194a989b31496f14f57bd004d90d49e3","a2d41b5d0f4e4a02a1a5d6aaae3ec952916c7817","a36b281bd0fac2d31fae0610275857280ee5a275","a528a6ac54b58d0aecf876b062eecee980b4b93d","afcb24f56054b7cd3b73f9e7e3303c3e987a80e1","ba10111bbdddbf13da4e691f497f2fba06e87669","bbee0c557be5e5a4da05a2509084fe1123cb0986","be7191af5672c41961c5af922d7d7e0d7c65801b","c5602ec7babf8b64a98cd3052906f808e73b8376","c66e33bfd4e667245c77ca7fa3b00f6473692d3a","ca6b5758a0103ac51f459220430c7b4673c3fa8e","cf95aa88e3af0d13fc26e1211e359cc39a2a96e6","d13de6bea9cf058c834bfa42b00c103e6f035a51","d15ae61e5e91c9ae03318eb306068b1deafa074b","d53dc8321b014af9e8f6835a256a28ae9449f0bc","d5dcbcfd49d5e779d747b836f39e69aa1e22994f","db975f2fb0c675ccbb97047ec92f30f1eaa9ef66","de05531bbfb67304eed510513c1e9a3150484b47","e4bb47f9120afdd70a3e236c8b8df02f5c3b225a","e821a311bf3b65d1d65d796dc4b6d6448e0627b6","eb8967622973a360273b488c554b4a83cb1ab2ba","eb8dcd095ec1b5445d27c5179583c3ee2bc4851d","f4a6c0c75d97d36eed5e3e763583236693f17577","f81a7b31445391504642633fbff8ca6b29114b44","fdb43a622cb37c00ea3fae567944792721e4b332",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":7749,"abstract":"[1] We present the Met Office Hadley Centre's sea ice and sea surface temperature (SST) data set, HadISST1, and the nighttime marine air temperature (NMAT) data set, HadMAT1. HadISST1 replaces the global sea ice and sea surface temperature (GISST) data sets and is a unique combination of monthly globally complete fields of SST and sea ice concentration on a 1° latitude-longitude grid from 1871. The companion HadMAT1 runs monthly from 1856 on a 5° latitude-longitude grid and incorporates new corrections for the effect on NMAT of increasing deck (and hence measurement) heights. HadISST1 and HadMAT1 temperatures are reconstructed using a two-stage reduced-space optimal interpolation procedure, followed by superposition of quality-improved gridded observations onto the reconstructions to restore local detail. The sea ice fields are made more homogeneous by compensating satellite microwave-based sea ice concentrations for the impact of surface melt effects on retrievals in the Arctic and for algorithm deficiencies in the Antarctic and by making the historical in situ concentrations consistent with the satellite data. SSTs near sea ice are estimated using statistical relationships between SST and sea ice concentration. HadISST1 compares well with other published analyses, capturing trends in global, hemispheric, and regional SST well, containing SST fields with more uniform variance through time and better month-to-month persistence than those in GISST. HadMAT1 is more consistent with SST and with collocated land surface air temperatures than previous NMAT data sets."},{"id":"88b80d9466a4fb941c2b5b463dba1e2a4f23ebf4","doi":"10.1029/2018JD029537","title":"Effects of Deforestation on the Onset of the Rainy Season and the Duration of Dry Spells in Southern Amazonia","authors":[{"LN":"Leite-Filho","FN":"Argemiro Teixeira"},{"LN":"Pontes","FN":"Verônica Yameê Sousa"},{"LN":"Costa","FN":"M.

This study uses daily rainfall time series data from 112 rain gauges and a recent yearly 1‐km land use data set covering the period from 1974 to 2012 to evaluate the effects of the extent of deforestation at different spatial scales on the onset of the rainy season and on the duration of dry spells in southern Amazonia. Correlation analyses indicate a delay in the onset of 0.12–0.17 days per percent increase in deforestation. Analysis of cumulative probability density functions emphasizes that the likelihood of rainy season onset occurring earlier than normal decreases as the local deforestation fraction increases. In addition, the probability of occurrence of dry spells in the early and late rainy season is higher in areas with greater deforestation. The delayed onset and longer dry spell events in highly deforested areas increase the climate risk to agriculture in the region."},{"id":"9e2b5146d43268cde0a223c4ebafead8b63d7528","doi":"10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0828.1","title":"Early-Warning Signals for the Onsets of Greenland Interstadials and the Younger Dryas–Preboreal Transition","authors":[{"LN":"Rypdal","FN":"M."}],"year":2015,"journal":"","references":["122da8d29ce3b7be8bd275ce07f76ae0f5881310","1eee0716723024ef7e99b702f1bb2dc1901a4e16","244084b5eae9de5e31e30789647269ace4e13f71","25a536717127c750e76415cd065ae67746179ba8","2c455f0da2bd86a9b9ea432d1485049073d7c63d","39f5ee58f4364c092bbc3064c1683901faa62dc0","4550ec4ae20cb7bd3bf3b647ac65a93da033d465","4c081113ddadbb316dfe654cfc0a330d25ff0722","4d41108590a7823ea9b943bd4c614534edba3b8d","4d8302b56f7839302750fb1dc81f730872a2790f","5e08d5ef785ee6b6b8ed1784dde5c99323336c85","6ef5f14bee23e150535bbc780b5ad0066ad7021d","71e5bf5ae110faef15ff52b9e5a669d8ad344c9a","809c11a0d0eed7b8d4fb97418b8895bb1eb308d3","83d404c8b508303b47aad52c158a00d988f5c42b","a0e55ee7863e47348a8cd9c9387fa6cb82d29478","a7d1407f6262ebb6bd5a45f9e9aca38e6045ecd6","b04913d88286ed289b05129d98fa3930df2e88f5","b090dd10b0f218261172d7d0f6c1492e696e0016","b58b3b958705aa8815e121ebb6e45d26ed0fd69e","ca3d4de2462fd81e15e2e23ce8bf6e13ef8dc8fc","cf7776ef39cffa0632b45e2872591e314a64243f","d5a50c2c4a6345ba6b5a326303e01214f314d7fd","d93b7d89c8970fe6ab94bc391559ded2d559d3f5","dea7e3cef4e4b661719f6d3ca277712c05693867","df7f417194f887f535752e1b5c2cb469eb1e0c89","e18a91369273412a56e27424da6f0547ea77c564","e24d4555ac3743fa68b9032274778f10e3720bfa","e5b99bfdc3d993767e39b4d60028dc4e358d1721","f8de1da740a2e4edca5d7aa7d4f3876c21b55edb","fc13db298f988ceceeb56738e821c003e72bbef1",null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":21,"abstract":"Source: Journal of Climate doi: 10.4236/am.2016.715143 \n \n© 2016 American Meteorological Society (AMS).

A drought of similar climatological magnitude occurred again in 2010; however, there has been no basin-wide ground-based evaluation of effects on vegetation. We examine to what extent the 2010 drought affected forest dynamics using ground-based observations of mortality and growth from an extensive forest plot network. We find that during the 2010 drought interval, forests did not gain biomass (net change: −0.43 Mg ha−1, confidence interval (CI): −1.11, 0.19, n = 97), regardless of whether forests experienced precipitation deficit anomalies. This contrasted with a long-term biomass sink during the baseline pre-2010 drought period (1998 to pre-2010) of 1.33 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (CI: 0.90, 1.74, p < 0.01). The resulting net impact of the 2010 drought (i.e., reversal of the baseline net sink) was −1.95 Mg ha−1 yr−1 (CI:−2.77, −1.18; p < 0.001). This net biomass impact was driven by an increase in biomass mortality (1.45 Mg ha−1 yr−1 CI: 0.66, 2.25, p < 0.001) and a decline in biomass productivity (−0.50 Mg ha−1 yr−1, CI:−0.78, −0.31; p < 0.001). Surprisingly, the magnitude of the losses through tree mortality was unrelated to estimated local precipitation anomalies and was independent of estimated local pre-2010 drought history. Thus, there was no evidence that pre-2010 droughts compounded the effects of the 2010 drought. We detected a systematic basin-wide impact of the 2010 drought on tree growth rates across Amazonia, which was related to the strength of the moisture deficit. This impact differed from the drought event in 2005 which did not affect productivity. Based on these ground data, live biomass in trees and corresponding estimates of live biomass in lianas and roots, we estimate that intact forests in Amazonia were carbon neutral in 2010 (−0.07 Pg C yr−1 CI:−0.42, 0.23), consistent with results from an independent analysis of airborne estimates of land-atmospheric fluxes during 2010. Relative to the long-term mean, the 2010 drought resulted in a reduction in biomass carbon uptake of 1.1 Pg C, compared to 1.6 Pg C for the 2005 event."},{"id":"dcb70f058a5db720462641b5090235b66cbb18ae","doi":"10.1111/GCB.14413","title":"Compositional response of Amazon forests to climate change","authors":[{"LN":"Esquivel‐Muelbert","FN":"Adriane"},{"LN":"Baker","FN":"T."},{"LN":"Dexter","FN":"K."},{"LN":"Lewis","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Brienen","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Feldpausch","FN":"T."},{"LN":"Lloyd","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Monteagudo-Mendoza","FN":"A."},{"LN":"Arroyo","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Álvarez-Dávila","FN":"Esteban"},{"LN":"Higuchi","FN":"N."},{"LN":"Marimon","FN":"B."},{"LN":"Marimon‐Junior","FN":"B.

Most of the planet's diversity is concentrated in the tropics, which includes many regions undergoing rapid climate change. Yet, while climate‐induced biodiversity changes are widely documented elsewhere, few studies have addressed this issue for lowland tropical ecosystems. Here we investigate whether the floristic and functional composition of intact lowland Amazonian forests have been changing by evaluating records from 106 long‐term inventory plots spanning 30 years. We analyse three traits that have been hypothesized to respond to different environmental drivers (increase in moisture stress and atmospheric CO 2 concentrations): maximum tree size, biogeographic water‐deficit affiliation and wood density. Tree communities have become increasingly dominated by large‐statured taxa, but to date there has been no detectable change in mean wood density or water deficit affiliation at the community level, despite most forest plots having experienced an intensification of the dry season. However, among newly recruited trees, dry‐affiliated genera have become more abundant, while the mortality of wet‐affiliated genera has increased in those plots where the dry season has intensified most. Thus, a slow shift to a more dry‐affiliated Amazonia is underway, with changes in compositional dynamics (recruits and mortality) consistent with climate‐change drivers, but yet to significantly impact whole‐community composition. The Amazon observational record suggests that the increase in atmospheric CO 2 is driving a shift within tree communities to large‐statured species and that climate changes to date will impact forest composition, but long generation times of tropical trees mean that biodiversity change is lagging behind climate change."},{"id":"df45f6e2d2e3a4abac857b914cae703f225957a0","doi":"10.1038/386698A0","title":"Increased plant growth in the northern high latitudes from 1981 to 1991","authors":[{"LN":"Myneni","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Keeling","FN":"C.

Here we present evidence from satellite data that the photosynthetic activity of terrestrial vegetation increased from 1981 to 1991 in a manner that is suggestive of an increase in plant growth associated with a lengthening of the active growing season. The regions exhibiting the greatest increase lie between 45°N and 70°N, where marked warming has occurred in the spring time3 due to an early disappearance of snow4. The satellite data are concordant with an increase in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle of atmospheric carbon dioxide exceeding 20% since the early 1970s, and an advance of up to seven days in the timing of the drawdown of CO2 in spring and early summer1. Thus, both the satellite data and the CO2 record indicate that the global carbon cycle has responded to interannual fluctuations in surface air temperature which, although small at the global scale, are regionally highly significant."},{"id":"e2e16f3c123850dffbb38765ef8fd71ebaecdaca","doi":"10.1038/NCLIMATE2581","title":"Recent reversal in loss of global terrestrial biomass","authors":[{"LN":"Liu","FN":"Yi Y."},{"LN":"Dijk","FN":"A."},{"LN":"Jeu","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Canadell","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Mccabe","FN":"M."},{"LN":"Evans","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Guojie"}],"year":2015,"journal":"","references":["02bf65e2fd71afe618bccd2bdde9abfffb4f2408","04c3ca897f3806ebbb9b3182e93ca6db169b5cfe","05c124bebe2503a787fee0d460d981a14057df29","12c9bd9ad7bef172e95b7d466d0fda046a916ff8","24fc4534f0742af1218dc89b492dfe56a0b087e0","2800928d8db200401a3a2a3c62465ee33682af9b","29b65b3e50d48961ccf5e4fbc833ba711cd36ec6","42424fbf9eac600a513e67e5567a05037086ae08","4b2be152572810c329e5139fa015033e57c9322a","51ad9216faea7d92f797571931ff3c67b86c7cfc","52f94477b892f094274a14e12d97fee3ab37c3aa","5dfdef311de2b37ff3afd2f2f3030ea5cba9b9fd","64e515a468557ae1e9ae6056d6f39933dd8fde3b","69ebbd1299ac9b1db121b45dac14b943cdaa2fe7","6ee33b532ac99f65fedb3ad3241046b9aec4f8d0","88a849724e8327aa8c9334bfb15ec1b11951a542","892c2c0501e71453ebbc523d1954e703c65cb630","962c93a294f60acb2c91c9bf140fbb53b479fed2","9b1d0da53b2a8d364cc47b6cc2f28121e14863f2","a03691c1aea17b40a2f268d564c8dfe169bb65fc","a17566911a21eecb0969855f4f7fc5abb11bc2af","aa0df05306dfe88d6ab2402dd48695d3284277eb","b4a6593c101c801e3f131ae7bd6c47c3c5e47343","b837793874b364efdbd3976bf314f9ec008b3612","be0dd65557856a82329a44489d24e04577f15f26","c7347a74c5e27418e5891a4921502c4fbd496bb4","c741edc6748d080587c1a9812e45c2b70268710e","cb7c961251f22700cc6f27466b36c22604196646","cdc827ebbe2ff63452b110bd9fb35ba114fa01b0","d72a53e1350c78dc6950e3fa50c5ced281a976a1","f0e58f88232f158a69e873c112e87fd1fddf20e6",null,null],"citationsCount":381,"abstract":"Vegetation change is a key component of the carbon cycle, but quantifying these changes is challenging.

In tropical ecosystems, regional climate projections and modeled ecosystem responses vary greatly, leading to a significant source of uncertainty in global biogeochemical accounting and possible future climate feedbacks. Here, we combine an ensemble of IPCC-AR4 climate change projections for the Amazon Basin (eight general circulation models) with alternative ecosystem parameter sets for the dynamic global vegetation model, LPJmL. We evaluate LPJmL simulations of carbon stocks and fluxes against flux tower and aboveground biomass datasets for individual sites and the entire basin. Variability in LPJmL model sensitivity to future climate change is primarily related to light and water limitations through biochemical and water-balance-related parameters. Temperature-dependent parameters related to plant respiration and photosynthesis appear to be less important than vegetation dynamics (and their parameters) for determining the magnitude of ecosystem response to climate change. Variance partitioning approaches reveal that relationships between uncertainty from ecosystem dynamics and climate projections are dependent on geographic location and the targeted ecosystem process. Parameter uncertainty from the LPJmL model does not affect the trajectory of ecosystem response for a given climate change scenario and the primary source of uncertainty for Amazon ‘dieback’ results from the uncertainty among climate projections. Our approach for describing uncertainty is applicable for informing and prioritizing policy options related to mitigation and adaptation where long-term investments are required."},{"id":"0e56e9006d1a992de243e129025a000f3bc791a4","doi":"10.1073/PNAS.2024192118","title":"Critical slowing down suggests that the western Greenland Ice Sheet is close to a tipping point","authors":[{"LN":"Boers","FN":"N."},{"LN":"Rypdal","FN":"M."}],"year":2021,"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","references":[],"citationsCount":24,"abstract":"Significance It has been suggested that, in response to anthropogenic global warming, the Greenland Ice Sheet may reach a tipping point beyond which its current configuration would become unstable. A crucial nonlinear mechanism for the existence of this tipping point is the positive melt-elevation feedback: Melting reduces ice sheet height, exposing the ice sheet surface to warmer temperatures, which further accelerates melting. We reveal early-warning signals for a forthcoming critical transition from ice-core-derived height reconstructions and infer that the western Greenland Ice Sheet has been losing stability in response to rising temperatures. We show that the melt-elevation feedback is likely to be responsible for the observed destabilization. Our results suggest substantially enhanced melting in the near future. The Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) is a potentially unstable component of the Earth system and may exhibit a critical transition under ongoing global warming. Mass reductions of the GrIS have substantial impacts on global sea level and the speed of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation, due to the additional freshwater caused by increased meltwater runoff into the northern Atlantic. The stability of the GrIS depends crucially on the positive melt-elevation feedback (MEF), by which melt rates increase as the overall ice sheet height decreases under rising temperatures. Melting rates across Greenland have accelerated nonlinearly in recent decades, and models predict a critical temperature threshold beyond which the current ice sheet state is not maintainable. Here, we investigate long-term melt rate and ice sheet height reconstructions from the central-western GrIS in combination with model simulations to quantify the stability of this part of the GrIS. We reveal significant early-warning signals (EWS) indicating that the central-western GrIS is close to a critical transition. By relating the statistical EWS to underlying physical processes, our results suggest that the MEF plays a dominant role in the observed, ongoing destabilization of the central-western GrIS.

paper shows recent progress in our understanding of climate variability and trends in the Amazon region, and how these interact with land use change. The review includes an overview of up-to-date information on climate and hydrological variability, and on warming trends in Amazonia, which reached 0.6-0.7 °C over the last 40 years, with 2016 as the warmest year since at least 1950 (0.9 °C +0.3°C). We focus on local and remote drivers of climate variability and change. We review the impacts of these drivers on the length of dry season, the role of the forest in climate and carbon cycles, the resilience of the forest, the risk of fires and biomass burning, and the potential “die back” of the Amazon forests if surpassing a “tipping point”. The role of the Amazon in moisture recycling and transport is also investigated, and a review of model development for climate change projections in the region is included. In sum, future sustainability of the Amazonian forests and its many services requires management strategies that consider the likelihood of multi-year droughts superimposed on a continued warming trend. Science has assembled enough knowledge to underline the global and regional importance of an intact Amazon region that can support policymaking and to keep this sensitive ecosystem functioning. This major challenge requires substantial resources and strategic cross-national planning, and a unique blend of expertise and capacities established in Amazon countries and from international collaboration. This also highlights the role of deforestation control in in support of policy for mitigation options as established in the Paris Agreement of 2015."},{"id":"2dba24d0ae646a9562d1bdef3b2605325e65dc0f","doi":"10.1038/S41586-020-2035-0","title":"Asynchronous carbon sink saturation in African and Amazonian tropical forests","authors":[{"LN":"Hubau","FN":"W."},{"LN":"Lewis","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Phillips","FN":"O."},{"LN":"Affum-Baffoe","FN":"K."},{"LN":"Beeckman","FN":"H."},{"LN":"Cuni‐Sanchez","FN":"A."},{"LN":"Daniels","FN":"Armandu K."},{"LN":"Ewango","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Fauset","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Mukinzi","FN":"Jacques M."},{"LN":"Sheil","FN":"D."},{"LN":"Sonké","FN":"B."},{"LN":"Sullivan","FN":"Martin J.

Climate-driven vegetation models typically predict that this tropical forest ‘carbon sink’ will continue for decades 4 , 5 . Here we assess trends in the carbon sink using 244 structurally intact African tropical forests spanning 11 countries, compare them with 321 published plots from Amazonia and investigate the underlying drivers of the trends. The carbon sink in live aboveground biomass in intact African tropical forests has been stable for the three decades to 2015, at 0.66 tonnes of carbon per hectare per year (95 per cent confidence interval 0.53–0.79), in contrast to the long-term decline in Amazonian forests 6 . Therefore the carbon sink responses of Earth’s two largest expanses of tropical forest have diverged. The difference is largely driven by carbon losses from tree mortality, with no detectable multi-decadal trend in Africa and a long-term increase in Amazonia. Both continents show increasing tree growth, consistent with the expected net effect of rising atmospheric carbon dioxide and air temperature 7 – 9 . Despite the past stability of the African carbon sink, our most intensively monitored plots suggest a post-2010 increase in carbon losses, delayed compared to Amazonia, indicating asynchronous carbon sink saturation on the two continents. A statistical model including carbon dioxide, temperature, drought and forest dynamics accounts for the observed trends and indicates a long-term future decline in the African sink, whereas the Amazonian sink continues to weaken rapidly. Overall, the uptake of carbon into Earth’s intact tropical forests peaked in the 1990s. Given that the global terrestrial carbon sink is increasing in size, independent observations indicating greater recent carbon uptake into the Northern Hemisphere landmass 10 reinforce our conclusion that the intact tropical forest carbon sink has already peaked. This saturation and ongoing decline of the tropical forest carbon sink has consequences for policies intended to stabilize Earth’s climate.

This study uses daily rainfall data from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission 3B42 product and a recent yearly 1-km land use dataset to evaluate the quantitative effects of deforestation on the onset, demise and length of the rainy season in southern Amazon for a period of 15 years (1998–2012). Additionally, we use the Niño4 index, zonal wind data and deforestation data to explain and predict the interannual variability of the onset of the rainy season. During this period, onset has delayed ~0.38 ± 0.05 days per year (5.7 ± 0.75 days in 15 years), demise has advanced 1.34 ± 0.76 days per year (20 ± 11.4 days in 15 years) and the rainy season has shortened by 1.81 ± 0.97 days per year (27 ± 14.5 days in 15 years).

Their physical cause remains debated, and previous research indicated that they are not preceded by classical early-warning signals (EWS). Subsequent research hypothesized that the DO events are caused by bifurcations of physical mechanisms operating at decadal timescales, and proposed to search for EWS in the high-frequency fluctuation levels. Here, a time series with 5-year resolution is obtained from the raw NGRIP record, and significant numbers of EWS in terms of variance and autocorrelation increases are revealed in the decadal-scale variability. Wavelet analysis indicates that the EWS are most pronounced in the 10–50-year periodicity band, confirming the above hypothesis. The DO events are hence neither directly noise-induced nor purely externally forced, which provides valuable constraints regarding potential physical causes.The Dansgaard-Oeschger events are remarkable examples of abrupt climate changes during the last ice age, yet a physical explanation remains debated.

Here, we explore the effect of some uncertainties in climate and land surface processes on the future of the forest, using a perturbed physics ensemble of HadCM3C. This is the first time Amazon forest changes are presented using an ensemble exploring both land vegetation processes and physical climate feedbacks in a fully coupled modelling framework. Under three different emissions scenarios, we measure the change in the forest coverage by the end of the 21st century (the transient response) and make a novel adaptation to a previously used method known as \"dry-season resilience\" to predict the long-term committed response of the forest, should the state of the climate remain constant past 2100. Our analysis of this ensemble suggests that there will be a high chance of greater forest loss on longer timescales than is realized by 2100, especially for mid-range and low emissions scenarios. In both the transient and predicted committed responses, there is an increasing uncertainty in the outcome of the forest as the strength of the emissions scenarios increases. It is important to note however, that very few of the simulations produce future forest loss of the magnitude previously shown under the standard model configuration. We find that low optimum temperatures for photosynthesis and a high minimum leaf area index needed for the forest to compete for space appear to be precursors for dieback. We then decompose the uncertainty into that associated with future climate change and that associated with forest resiliency, finding that it is important to reduce the uncertainty in both of these if we are to better determine the Amazon's outcome."},{"id":"ed8713ca0d4e263cbb12c0da16fe56d6abc732fd","doi":"10.1038/SDATA.2015.66","title":"The climate hazards infrared precipitation with stations—a

Using the Variable Infiltration Capacity model, we show that CHIRPS can support effective hydrologic forecasts and trend analyses in southeastern Ethiopia."},{"id":"06f08ba97a76ddc31ce51c47f70cc9cb4e79e9a6","doi":"10.1038/NCOMMS15519","title":"Amazonian forest-savanna bistability and human impact","authors":[{"LN":"Wuyts","FN":"Bert"},{"LN":"Champneys","FN":"A."},{"LN":"House","FN":"J."}],"year":2017,"journal":"Nature communications","references":["04359c2a99e7ba96ea5b2a54b508f1110fd72999","0de477d496b226525e56d2e6591a7721697dc2a8","12ffcf2f932d80993563a9ee47ce82738c201ca0","166474a80c0f37143f4b712c0bb6fc57434c7e13","1fb63b6f2cc7a14a18b0f7a8afa057b49666650a","2e7b175e98cf4e93b1e92005f2e0e69551cb73fa","3b8ef3d2d45e7e926fb35dd4ac23a3883baf5b52","4cfd9b2e9c7c01a407d186f3d9c87fd124cf5676","4f63d575decbf0e877e47a52f4140aab02fb3ed7","4ffd7867723c4b8de7ca25bd06906e8142c87296","53934358f5fff7dd1440bcfa97e79783a5b70316","56e949081c491e113e3f688a94b9f5cd2010f46f","5aedfb9750fe93dd3b70b60beb2f3c25b4f71277","66c431c2dfe70556dc021cf0e1b8a62c2531922f","697b3c5a9a2e157e3fa325c040ebd16680e0ea00","6ba3fb26c35e0e003103ecfd0e01c8385614d4ca","706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","72f624fefec292a3cb7a0973325b706e56942ac9","7a168be196992a76461961fcdcc9c30b50f3a8ec","80900fb85e2f29953b7d70fb59fa0e092cf41afe","878c531fc7889fb5b6b29733f8b74d186899cfc3","88af2bd20b6c977589b3c7ecc522174b0ff3e018","8c145259016de504934757482bce4480bf5c8784","8c73f15481828fd0552ba4a3fc06ce893c3a0c79","8d7373edc47650ee821bb95828409d25836201fb","9165732e932bfb2702f7a0b163d5f9c1e74a9845","922cd02a5e4f1298384cb5b9f6d13df5daf64b70","9489c271eaa958ee8526e57ef8ac6c955d8c0709","94e5cb39c64e253d1dc1b853286b04a8d1afc00d","9758a5cb826ed7199ee8822f08108fd6bbf7a106","99696f2830b7ef8e657b0bd6c775688d7581506a","997a2b9ae45190ddf25ad239925829f70752ce52","9bdf8afa76c1a7fbbc0fd58e7d6abcaa2817785e","9ecbc7447ccc033e108638dd6da4fe1a6a226eb6","a00bc15cebacc4880492fae783230237a0c96b9c","a6f7fafda70269b8fb562a88c09597e34362f4a2","a8b85ec27eec724e4a5cb7dfd9f9340bf364d678","ab7ff52e75748f2e43a48c48d6ac5dfbfd8cfcc4","afef030037e621538ac53e18d23a1a4660df79d8","b2fc91e1a77976152a990dc48911e71009e02f82","bbcf21177073d08f1c6c7335b4aec1aa381dda33","d2d1c5b6db0a49162e26cbe3681aba5746dac515","d72a53e1350c78dc6950e3fa50c5ced281a976a1","d7aa74690ce0bb9317236b7035df4042419509c7","db1bd3595aa14e566388db80b2cf47e7447d34de","dbb4a92166ef11e25f929377d167f4f021040efd","e0c4851e9aec1ee92b4d64cc32ec1916f4b4d983","e7cbc158fb3e592d1821d8d351a55bc3da342404","e8e8131a899cb83b03d61b9851e69068cf3394cb","eb81cbe0773b2dc092e35b163e63309d5ba9f891","f76079094119d06334a54aac40a3a38f10017b81","faa8d78e3cbb1f1e814a2808c56f8d08f0a06c74","fbfb5fb4646201931a819cb96a7b7971a45de5ca","fedd542a6c24f5dc2fc3b5cf8391326a605ccf85",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":51,"abstract":"A bimodal distribution of tropical tree cover at intermediate precipitation levels has been presented as evidence of fire-induced bistability.

Bimodality is found to be almost absent in the unaffected regions, whereas it is significantly enhanced close to cultivated zones. Assuming higher logging rates closer to cultivated zones and spatial diffusion of fire, our spatiotemporal mathematical model reproduces these patterns. Given a gradient of climatic and edaphic factors, rather than bistability there is a predictable spatial boundary, a Maxwell point, that separates regions where forest and savanna states are naturally selected. While bimodality can hence be explained by anthropogenic edge effects and natural spatial heterogeneity, a narrow range of bimodality remaining in the human-unaffected data indicates that there is still bistability, although on smaller scales than claimed previously."},{"id":"14a62330576422c5e984be619299206110bacefb","doi":"10.1126/SCIADV.ABA2949","title":"Amazon tipping point: Last chance for action","authors":[{"LN":"Lovejoy","FN":"T."},{"LN":"Nobre","FN":"C."}],"year":2019,"journal":"Science Advances","references":["2fa2b80aa2bfeb777f6e29168952af73176e4201","ccb5d68fc4aef32b84fcaf409b0b672c46a2bd51"],"citationsCount":73,"abstract":"Thomas E.

The rainforest recycles the moisture five to six times before it turns southward, feeling the proximity of the high wall of the Andes.

The equation governing tree cover in the model suggests that zero and non-zero stable states of tree cover co-exist, and a transcritical bifurcation is approached as productivity declines. Forest dieback is a non-linear change in the non-zero tree cover state, as productivity declines, which should exhibit critical slowing down. We use an ensemble of versions of HadCM3 to test for the corresponding early warning signals. However, on approaching simulated Amazon dieback, expected early warning signals of critical slowing down are not seen in tree cover, vegetation carbon or net primary productivity. The lack of a convincing trend in autocorrelation appears to be a result of the system being forced rapidly and non-linearly. There is a robust rise in variance with time, but this can be explained by increases in inter-annual temperature and precipitation variability that force the forest. This failure of generic early warning indicators led us to seek more system-specific, observable indicators of changing forest stability in the model. The sensitivity of net ecosystem productivity to temperature anomalies (a negative correlation) generally increases as dieback approaches, which is attributable to a non-linear sensitivity of ecosystem respiration to temperature. As a result, the sensitivity of atmospheric CO2 anomalies to temperature anomalies (a positive correlation) increases as dieback approaches. This stability indicator has the benefit of being readily observable in the real world."},{"id":"434ca529b68aabfb4835ac2cb8a8a3da6f83efe1","doi":"10.1088/1748-9326/AB9CFF","title":"An early-warning indicator for Amazon droughts exclusively based on tropical Atlantic sea surface temperatures","authors":[{"LN":"Ciemer","FN":"Catrin"},{"LN":"Rehm","FN":"Lars"},{"LN":"Kurths","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Donner","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Winkelmann","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Boers","FN":"N."}],"year":2020,"journal":"","references":["0316374ff1199b079471543f239fe68622a97cec","0bd45c23f2e32de7edf334432a765842883b0968","12334afe89c06c07a1409d4442a1d51c26e10d93","12771dd7bbcfc1d025aa4e6379bbf6a31cb51d18","1605448e0a7784977cbf1cfb09f3d3b0ce9533d2","17680fd853f379a1222809fd3b0a914ea034323d","1d2b88cdca8f382dce619b818b562b85f7e17411","1dc886ac2f208422112e7670647c99b5e22966ed","2ef3d560d93620d057ce0fc65b07e6267a9aff31","30b58ad6dfff36f7366df9f2b851466f796b967b","354f931b92a51180bbeaf49f89d662ee7984ab50","365ab3e5a0b058d8acf37cf03687d83b9a8941c6","38ac8621e56003d0c91ecf4e3d24f403f28d5a9d","4097d1d38c786f89b895eb17daaf2de1d1a79b14","4c0bfb8b92b287f58c0487c79e4083f5b8b4a552","50963d76d9ba8b0e39cbe5616234a1cc87cae52e","65989ad6a285e94fce9a180d82266a9e1c51dc1e","68b7efac05d1761d3ada2419bbdeb37220566bf5","6f44552f1a1e9752610efab648b10d1bba6148f7","762aa6130506c839e3dfe7fc2e15b4962aa41b94","7eb633f568c0be35e77b1ddadf7d867c3ed0cb14","821d1bad58a5697a4a521bf169a256b9ca34084a","824fbf100b6b2a569abda5347f31b40270783f56","852a3dff0d0f852641d5de3daa93dc57c570e6f2","a010b76e1a809da5a128def075a310b1b1511593","a3f78c433942f915a40cc0f994056d286b611ff1","a5765169625611cbd0f322b26e7eff2bfb98c1ef","a8cc30f4e21e94e2789615df4d08c05d9e7c66c7","acc59a30d83ff1a9b64e0ab38918baf635b1891d","ba9eebacf27fed90db8b1ec70c3ef6446a144cfd","c3f7136d6cb726b295eb34565a8270177c57f40f","d2d1c5b6db0a49162e26cbe3681aba5746dac515","d5c6603b13e566d0c1508db4ed82e517f18253b6","d73b49915376faf12fa1a1ea803faab9d701caee","e317820eff7bf69a4989edec5054dc541e88d77d","ed8713ca0d4e263cbb12c0da16fe56d6abc732fd","fbac5ff94174ca783e731a7a4007c96248288bfe","ff77d554e4174900682f17e13834b1a56052fb81",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":7,"abstract":"Droughts in tropical South America have an imminent and severe impact on the Amazon rainforest and affect the livelihoods of millions of people. Extremely dry conditions in Amazonia have been previously linked to sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies in the adjacent tropical oceans. Although the sources and impacts of such droughts have been widely studied, establishing reliable multi-year lead statistical forecasts of their occurrence is still an ongoing challenge. Here, we further investigate the relationship between SST and rainfall anomalies using a complex network approach. We identify four ocean regions which exhibit the strongest overall SST correlations with central Amazon rainfall, including two particularly prominent regions in the northern and southern tropical Atlantic. Based on the time-dependent correlation between SST anomalies in these two regions alone, we establish a new early-warning method for droughts in the central Amazon basin and demonstrate its robustness in hindcasting past major drought events with lead-times up to 18 months."},{"id":"505e022f19daaf96a59040e72c7194599c219af7","doi":"10.5194/ESSD-12-177-2020","title":"The global long-term microwave Vegetation Optical Depth Climate Archive (VODCA)","authors":[{"LN":"Moesinger","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Dorigo","FN":"W."},{"LN":"Jeu","FN":"R. de"},{"LN":"Schalie","FN":"R. van der"},{"LN":"Scanlon","FN":"T."},{"LN":"Teubner","FN":"Irene E."},{"LN":"Forkel","FN":"M."}],"year":2020,"journal":"","references":["01f5955a3e483bd3a483be4246c90304c5ce7cae","0b2d742dd0fe129e484622ca9ca4097fb1649f66","0c396e11fa8a962ebe46936ed319ca1051096449","0d3f34db3b90d48fddaac721782f0401e1ab34d2","10d16e2894db44abd8078caca934eaf02402e1e4","1673bede20fd42a3b3aba40a1ced653bc206a379","177385a8671f541812dbc14610891326185ec431","19a6a05e802e42bdf560d258a4497335cd9e1f4f","1b42be4c685d3b79d4ccb661d218a6db6080959a","1ccb70ca28b63cf5187d1fa660e202c44091e924","1dc6fde41a4236a778bf2ce93e53411110ad91d6","1dec3245eb094c789d81fa3e172982af4ee33574","2055c468a3bc4ab348c8d239fce91edb7d27aae3","22ada00aac87fd2ad0d1835386111f12a91f80bd","24fc4534f0742af1218dc89b492dfe56a0b087e0","268e50c10f32481f9d15b25cb2cb530090b7d0bc","2ac01c622fd97e8bf31b014d489ad2a6949d37e9","2b0a7825437868625a7afe508a72b53db013a62b","2c3f0e22ba0ce08b3811afa1239c1ef4307b2c0f","3076711ef383096cdeb599bf7168fb2d43b0d6f7","3847b83264a110b1fa85efc21002dbdcfee701b8","3daf5c30d9fb6e27ea3a5f44d30475988a83bf7e","3ffb691778307d004ebd22e5c2eca0f320f6841a","44fa9af8cd96fd73aba1f7ea6c55620dddac23f7","4cb620f5715552ea1b079761b62aaa7e66759057","51ad9216faea7d92f797571931ff3c67b86c7cfc","5495cc817a20ca0706ff79f70d8fc52c464c596c","56a90938d5bfea6040023979934b1e0ff2d67783","595994ea3d6d5bce055c94a8dd8e030a91a57fdd","5c52081d5dec619fd591bec19b9672cbadb0602e","61482897d130f8d73fc3f167ca8113b4e008ae6c","6ad2fd7a469701e6ca208180057036fc6c5a89bd","6bb3a5f225675d802c4dea656c35e3da2e444515","6bf6589b8979c28bd739104c9ec7c2b014f3e309","879a1756a7e218e4c23511ac84b61ab181ab640a","8950681b41e88a51ecfb0f683fb9f30c9a0e0e05","89a264c9f08ba51f16a93e98b5d1ca0e70f942a3","8d8910f855ac27dc41e3034650064988007c075a","91652419beaaabca6038ccd1b16c29a5f81c966d","91f92ca8b4fe294c9a1eb4f5c6f2a2b84030b8d1","9a17d3f6c299606195547d5b94c883a46dee4b4f","9cf0c5d523f083fcab91760ed96b0d3d1ebb0b99","a254fbf63c3a3df9b8918432f1c17e1f41ec6d62","aae42b28f188ddca4c3d23c28633d4723f86c5a7","abfcd9139be4a4505902fb787adab7b686365c1f","b047a56d832a80653fa99252dc005ac5d5bfe55c","b179af53ef1060a82467d09f2e0410475866a4c5","b1d177e8274d198b22d8cc6d742f4f2fa640ea58","bdb8ba46c9747edb86d9ca5b5c8e82d76ad01378","c0d58faacb626079a2c1eb595880bfbc89a09ec4","c1fee2b7682c35aeb1caf3b8e28cc87691379095","c6e7ff04f80ca3d34b3af1a46aabefd8718f60df","d7d47572930bbeb21b91b398df050b6e71cbe785","db5875b249485c33bed0fb7d2baaa109c3b4e4f4","dd483b6709c3b9fbb9635bbff8cf62c143c7a5d5","e2e16f3c123850dffbb38765ef8fd71ebaecdaca","e403b9fd7c2f3f6380d72f978490362b99f46c3d","e5848787cc4ab12d6636c5a5ba23112fc31d75a7","ebe924b7f6c21e29f83cbbce96abf1417e400d04","ed864e22c34e43c7f939aa764cb2ae81b5771185","f077ed850896a9f361e29759894cc9cbc3059c00","f26d2908c2ea6d9d4e76cac3a244652617f23b84","f5ca30ccf6222431c271c2c8672b842916806bbc","f5dc0cbf426013ddd0f074f0b1208cf98192978e","f9b46b7c16956e792821185c5ef3eed5a5b4cec6","fda07f3c725f2851ebd65f85d6535bd1e843efb5",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":56,"abstract":"Abstract. Since the late 1970s, space-borne microwave radiometers have been providing measurements of radiation emitted by the Earth’s surface. From these measurements it is possible to derive vegetation optical depth (VOD), a model-based indicator related to the density, biomass, and water content of vegetation. Because of its high temporal resolution and long availability, VOD can be used to monitor short- to long-term changes in vegetation. However, studying long-term VOD dynamics is generally hampered by the relatively short time span covered by the individual microwave sensors. This can potentially be overcome by merging multiple VOD products into a single climate data record. However, combining multiple sensors into a single product is challenging as systematic differences between input products like biases, different temporal and spatial resolutions, and coverage need to be overcome. Here, we present a new series of long-term VOD products, the VOD Climate Archive (VODCA). VODCA combines VOD retrievals that have been derived from multiple sensors (SSM/I, TMI, AMSR-E, WindSat, and AMSR2) using the Land Parameter Retrieval Model. We produce separate VOD products for microwave observations in different spectral bands, namely the Ku-band (period 1987–2017), X-band (1997–2018), and C-band (2002–2018). In this way, our multi-band VOD products preserve the unique characteristics of each frequency with respect to the structural elements of the canopy. Our merging approach builds on an existing approach that is used to merge satellite products of surface soil moisture: first, the data sets are co-calibrated via cumulative distribution function matching using AMSR-E as the scaling reference. To do so, we apply a new matching technique that scales outliers more robustly than ordinary piecewise linear interpolation. Second, we aggregate the data sets by taking the arithmetic mean between temporally overlapping observations of the scaled data. The characteristics of VODCA are assessed for self-consistency and against other products. Using an autocorrelation analysis, we show that the merging of the multiple data sets successfully reduces the random error compared to the input data sets. Spatio-temporal patterns and anomalies of the merged products show consistency between frequencies and with leaf area index observations from the MODIS instrument as well as with Vegetation Continuous Fields from the AVHRR instruments. Long-term trends in Ku-band VODCA show that since 1987 there has been a decline in VOD in the tropics and in large parts of east-central and north Asia, while a substantial increase is observed in India, large parts of Australia, southern Africa, southeastern China, and central North America. In summary, VODCA shows vast potential for monitoring spatial–temporal ecosystem changes as it is sensitive to vegetation water content and unaffected by cloud cover or high sun zenith angles. As such, it complements existing long-term optical indices of greenness and leaf area.

Significant early-warning signals are found in eight independent AMOC indices, based on observational sea-surface temperature and salinity data from across the Atlantic Ocean basin. These results reveal spatially consistent empirical evidence that, in the course of the last century, the AMOC may have evolved from relatively stable conditions to a point close to a critical transition.

Here we reveal that if the Amazon region becomes drier as predicted, forests may collapse first on seasonally inundated areas due to their vulnerability to wildfires. The widespread distribution of floodplain forests at the western and central regions implies that fire-prone savannas may expand deep into this massive forest biome, threatening the resilience of the entire system. Our findings suggest the need for a strategic fire management plan to strengthen Amazonian forest resilience in the face of climate change. The massive forests of central Amazonia are often considered relatively resilient against climatic variation, but this view is challenged by the wildfires invoked by recent droughts. The impact of such fires that spread from pervasive sources of ignition may reveal where forests are less likely to persist in a drier future. Here we combine field observations with remotely sensed information for the whole Amazon to show that the annually inundated lowland forests that run through the heart of the system may be trapped relatively easily into a fire-dominated savanna state. This lower forest resilience on floodplains is suggested by patterns of tree cover distribution across the basin, and supported by our field and remote sensing studies showing that floodplain fires have a stronger and longer-lasting impact on forest structure as well as soil fertility. Although floodplains cover only 14% of the Amazon basin, their fires can have substantial cascading effects because forests and peatlands may release large amounts of carbon, and wildfires can spread to adjacent uplands. Floodplains are thus an Achilles’ heel of the Amazon system when it comes to the risk of large-scale climate-driven transitions."},{"id":"d4a22bb96196c2e2df704a162522c53678091bb3","doi":"10.1038/NCLIMATE3108","title":"Remotely sensed resilience of tropical forests","authors":[{"LN":"Verbesselt","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Umlauf","FN":"Nikolaus"},{"LN":"Hirota","FN":"M."},{"LN":"Holmgren","FN":"M."},{"LN":"Nes","FN":"E.

This carbon sink seems to be in decline, however, as a result of factors such as deforestation and climate change1-3. Here we investigate Amazonia's carbon budget and the main drivers responsible for its change into a carbon source. We performed 590 aircraft vertical profiling measurements of lower-tropospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide at four sites in Amazonia from 2010 to 20184. We find that total carbon emissions are greater in eastern Amazonia than in the western part, mostly as a result of spatial differences in carbon-monoxide-derived fire emissions. Southeastern Amazonia, in particular, acts as a net carbon source (total carbon flux minus fire emissions) to the atmosphere. Over the past 40 years, eastern Amazonia has been subjected to more deforestation, warming and moisture stress than the western part, especially during the dry season, with the southeast experiencing the strongest trends5-9. We explore the effect of climate change and deforestation trends on carbon emissions at our study sites, and find that the intensification of the dry season and an increase in deforestation seem to promote ecosystem stress, increase in fire occurrence, and higher carbon emissions in the eastern Amazon. This is in line with recent studies that indicate an increase in tree mortality and a reduction in photosynthesis as a result of climatic changes across Amazonia1,10."},{"id":"5dc181dfa8bc497d90844ba4c6a49be8ee6fa338","doi":"10.1038/S41558-022-01287-8","title":"Pronounced loss of Amazon rainforest resilience since the early 2000s","authors":[{"LN":"Boulton","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Lenton","FN":"T."},{"LN":"Boers","FN":"N."}],"year":2022,"journal":"Nature Climate Change","references":["045555ec4342da07074949f540bc615cb8c453cf","04f4c68fa7bc5c9ea550076bb911b68b052d28a7","06f08ba97a76ddc31ce51c47f70cc9cb4e79e9a6","0de477d496b226525e56d2e6591a7721697dc2a8","0e56e9006d1a992de243e129025a000f3bc791a4","12334afe89c06c07a1409d4442a1d51c26e10d93","14a62330576422c5e984be619299206110bacefb","17680fd853f379a1222809fd3b0a914ea034323d","296bc78c86d17481e9b8983632773f3c5666b2af","2b0dd59254ed9d1255f817e427ede2c9f53e5e5f","2dba24d0ae646a9562d1bdef3b2605325e65dc0f","4193801389ca6257f44f0d7d8899bb4651375ede","434ca529b68aabfb4835ac2cb8a8a3da6f83efe1","467f0fdc420f5cd8996c0b2b1eb33a3dcda93c5e","4d41108590a7823ea9b943bd4c614534edba3b8d","4e16328e599e9d3169f40b6dbfbd039b4ca673a2","505e022f19daaf96a59040e72c7194599c219af7","53564c45fe0af4889c92f05b04626f7ac739a97a","585bf445ec84c1d9621b2726bdcce9f544b515c8","5c2ae3bf77fbca2feb457e60861232af41b44403","5c6a907a418896b8aee17663e8c87895c1622fd3","5cdc695ab97a720e468d28868528c785fbd8a114","68e014afbe6940b43981f8a572e3d995a4a95240","6c69a425959a4e98df944c10300258f18119c3b7","706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","70fae121f412c19612115eff06c13134b8cb2060","7411530aa26843b62f9174fa9d004bab72e476dc","8766710c66d2a93541f61003d2d2562573636f2d","88b80d9466a4fb941c2b5b463dba1e2a4f23ebf4","922cd02a5e4f1298384cb5b9f6d13df5daf64b70","963c95a977e4ce253791a7683ee19d91514a2002","9758a5cb826ed7199ee8822f08108fd6bbf7a106","9e2b5146d43268cde0a223c4ebafead8b63d7528","a010b76e1a809da5a128def075a310b1b1511593","a4b6e12005d58e512712405b351ae128b5f9300f","a6bc4a16d203b6c7c69fc7420eaf13fa59a8218c","ac2f7ce4fd521c11d3654b85839b96ef41a0f287","b40f6f5f1f5931a2f902da254405c554e3ca6b9c","be3eda717b99731f93de80d75031f38e40f84cee","c2dae083b5d082978b1994dc79c19d32a0b3274a","c706f5b8184a145e4f9d6ffbd62f6757c3badc3e","c9b832926aef3e37c81fc5f1ced7e853a6cae6a1","ccb5d68fc4aef32b84fcaf409b0b672c46a2bd51","d3d718f3f0e4e6d91b3b13524b3e90496e76f841","d4a22bb96196c2e2df704a162522c53678091bb3","d5237678e6d12e95bf989f7972fc065cc3800d55","d7aa74690ce0bb9317236b7035df4042419509c7","dcb70f058a5db720462641b5090235b66cbb18ae","df45f6e2d2e3a4abac857b914cae703f225957a0","df6ade47d3bbab757e8fcf6b3f026b7d3d44ed01","e2e16f3c123850dffbb38765ef8fd71ebaecdaca","e43256238dbfcf1fe37aac918a6d2d033e22d380","ed8713ca0d4e263cbb12c0da16fe56d6abc732fd","f7014c1b0b2e820ba82a017924590f3098b49910","fedd542a6c24f5dc2fc3b5cf8391326a605ccf85",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citationsCount":0,"abstract":"The resilience of the Amazon rainforest to climate and land-use change is crucial for biodiversity, regional climate and the global carbon cycle. Deforestation and climate change, via increasing dry-season length and drought frequency, may already have pushed the Amazon close to a critical threshold of rainforest dieback. Here, we quantify changes of Amazon resilience by applying established indicators (for example, measuring lag-1 autocorrelation) to remotely sensed vegetation data with a focus on vegetation optical depth (1991–2016). We find that more than three-quarters of the Amazon rainforest has been losing resilience since the early 2000s, consistent with the approach to a critical transition. Resilience is being lost faster in regions with less rainfall and in parts of the rainforest that are closer to human activity. We provide direct empirical evidence that the Amazon rainforest is losing resilience, risking dieback with profound implications for biodiversity, carbon storage and climate change at a global scale. The Amazon rainforest is increasingly under pressure from climate change and deforestation. The resilience of three-quarters of the forest, particularly in drier areas or close to human activity, has been decreasing since the 2000s, indicating that the system may be approaching a tipping point.","isSource":true}],"incomingSuggestions":[{"id":"a637f09be32f8ff15cf16b60321aaa74cb208ac1","doi":"10.1007/S00704-004-0049-4","title":"Amazonian forest dieback under climate-carbon cycle projections for the 21st century","authors":[{"LN":"Cox","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Betts","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Collins","FN":"M."},{"LN":"Harris","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Huntingford","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Jones","FN":"Chris D."}],"year":2004,"journal":"","references":["04532635146d68b54c265e8054e7a8cb49801031","2174a398f9114b7694760775603087ca8daaa413","36c8816a06575d6c20455c820fe037a8ad283a8d","3f99f268a65485c77adfcebb8de0454cfe1f9a2a","40871ce647aab03834231540cae0001ba89def16","4267dbeb5dc099b4c648c234609856a351ff9d3e","4a31feb8468936a9bb3246196bcff5a3bc2d0c99","4b50133d32e861d43a20df41c42d13a86a8e6845","53919d771d66d723a5eeacf39a655206ab92d86a","576f4bf73172086c3772d81f52ea97e65dcbbf65","5c2ae3bf77fbca2feb457e60861232af41b44403","5d29f38c115848e49dee9fa75cf7194cfb842c22","6de431554efb7b31b213adfdbc02d859e4ef31d7","6e4e83e30520e4941e83c6a19fdad2d62b0c97e5","6f145527f533dc8bdf8ee228a82f7961566b7355","71a56116bc4f294463bb4863ac33087556df3ed3","7b93ab992a754cca4326d0a5ed84cee9d518811b","7dedeb1d928ff8c4e6d0d9fccee1abc431bb528d","85710271d78b37e7a97d116d573d34acdafcd0b5","87181b6a1e291e487e6e5de9bb8b005d15bcecaa","8961823e798404ebe8add9322754604f0795237a","8a751c91d39b9acaaa8d70d2dabe038febce17f5","90f7bdbd989d77ab2813895f65357aa7f717aeb9","92ffdb779deaca996f752abaa0bc2935e8c27e8c","af189c1c8bd6238cc34f8a572f0ff69d213239ec","af70b12f6abc3dee863624abadd2224ea60951fe","b0ed15f5a68cfe1e4c042da182773841f690942e","b11f482c8e5a93f607655225415d0ade5b288fdc","b214624cfd3764c091804c73ed213d4f85f03cba","b4075346ddc65ab2b47116fb3b3bf228bc1abef2","bcdc63cf9ba72c73a31ce9d05bc43cc98cf130aa","bcdec176d64fc1b75ddbedc3efc64a98dc09e4ed","bf1d0f059695e2f81df488f9e85844cca44590b6","c31ec338aa000856c21bc6a78a876fc843af064a","cf8647d195c7a4a504db0a5ddab82a6d8929858f","d2272dd9ff850edc448f7fde86eef6bcd57af2cc","d2c771e9b38130bc1105ef3ce968c19eb73af261","e1f5ce8991e809dcb0b60b9fb609117999b72352","e74d3b4372a3033c2411f4ecf47012632a74b9d1","f20dcd598238631c5766421a581f9b5ab7f105b8","f4c3d185ae0b0ed44765b2c8582671bc49c5db60","fedd542a6c24f5dc2fc3b5cf8391326a605ccf85",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citations":[],"citationsCount":766,"abstract":"SummaryThe first GCM climate change projections to include dynamic vegetation and an interactive carbon cycle produced a very significant amplification of global warming over the 21st century.

We used records from multiple long-term monitoring plots across Amazonia to assess forest responses to the intense 2005 drought, a possible analog of future events. Affected forest lost biomass, reversing a large long-term carbon sink, with the greatest impacts observed where the dry season was unusually intense. Relative to pre-2005 conditions, forest subjected to a 100-millimeter increase in water deficit lost 5.3 megagrams of aboveground biomass of carbon per hectare.

Amazon forests therefore appear vulnerable to increasing moisture stress, with the potential for large carbon losses to exert feedback on climate change."},{"id":"b0cc7cc671c6b4d251d480a3dda2eb3ba79e8db1","doi":"10.1073/PNAS.0804619106","title":"Exploring the likelihood and mechanism of a climate-change-induced dieback of the Amazon rainforest","authors":[{"LN":"Malhi","FN":"Y."},{"LN":"Aragão","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Galbraith","FN":"D."},{"LN":"Huntingford","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Fisher","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Zelazowski","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Sitch","FN":"S."},{"LN":"McSweeney","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Meir","FN":"P."}],"year":2009,"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","references":["090256bdc67eace0034cdc673595803cede39617","1563068db0707d4cedcc14b4de057ab117fbed50","17680fd853f379a1222809fd3b0a914ea034323d","193157d65ace8bac8625d3617de42e5516bf653a","1d8c6d421da1e01e9e3c0cade4904de9e4240452","29e0b01bab1c7cea2a91f55ff0624162654ef127","2eed542cfb60b30f4fe0dbfa54b573398ba6993e","2f78828a333f2c2ba7f5c793ce26f380d5fc89fa","35ab138c1c0b0d83023abada822992191eea0e69","361c5a402b8e61f2df3bf7356b656c7c69264221","3ec481005e118dfdfbc6c0d5eff267eacf9e2c0a","4923d201cc50dc60ea1c78dd42b6092ce7e8863e","4d619b602c109930fccec728c2ad11b5da84c062","53919d771d66d723a5eeacf39a655206ab92d86a","614f0a07eab4d3240918acda9ca6180b58e89b19","62361cb63ed1c54d09063a13a98d946a1a635e8a","706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","7afcd328055f1e18f9f5e5f744f677e6c1427785","80409f2342be237a797ac94d5095efa57a55ec42","863c42b6f9ca86a8eba8105a064a7a5b01ec07d6","87be4d31120aaeed69e8329fbed88594ef6c9a30","8a331f5a3e5ee466fd8920ab57f3b08f67cf2843","91887a0bf5788a99ac5a7cf130bcf60cf8e79c75","a637f09be32f8ff15cf16b60321aaa74cb208ac1","a6bc4a16d203b6c7c69fc7420eaf13fa59a8218c","a6dba705b97fa5345374bd275ca5b08498f174f1","a8ee4ef420c2c6a90ee221bcb74b1663e111675c","ad291bd5b21860267afd7c5a1fc6d44148de71cf","b9bfa59b4e92d76d84a5041438427663f87e2b1c","cd340ab18afaab2163fcf109ce3b8a9db7a268ce","cfc1a3fbd2fe229045e0c53f7f9609e80ab3f8d5","d7b4a30c881f74acf8eae8cf4ccc79ef5d0437a3","d9dc43d94eb6fab81040ee44d19a02a66fce2cdb","da3b009864e1f75e882f3713a50e0de7bd977aa9","e3b85621274dad81a33ec4b7d07e3ba1857597dc",null,null,null,null],"citations":[],"citationsCount":797,"abstract":"We examine the evidence for the possibility that 21st-century climate change may cause a large-scale “dieback” or degradation of Amazonian rainforest. We employ a new framework for evaluating the rainfall regime of tropical forests and from this deduce precipitation-based boundaries for current forest viability. We then examine climate simulations by 19 global climate models (GCMs) in this context and find that most tend to underestimate current rainfall. GCMs also vary greatly in their projections of future climate change in Amazonia. We attempt to take into account the differences between GCM-simulated and observed rainfall regimes in the 20th century. Our analysis suggests that dry-season water stress is likely to increase in E. Amazonia over the 21st century, but the region tends toward a climate more appropriate to seasonal forest than to savanna. These seasonal forests may be resilient to seasonal drought but are likely to face intensified water stress caused by higher temperatures and to be vulnerable to fires, which are at present naturally rare in much of Amazonia. The spread of fire ignition associated with advancing deforestation, logging, and fragmentation may act as nucleation points that trigger the transition of these seasonal forests into fire-dominated, low biomass forests. Conversely, deliberate limitation of deforestation and fire may be an effective intervention to maintain Amazonian forest resilience in the face of imposed 21st-century climate change. Such intervention may be enough to navigate E. Amazonia away from a possible “tipping point,” beyond which extensive rainforest would become unsustainable."},{"id":"d2d1c5b6db0a49162e26cbe3681aba5746dac515","doi":"10.1038/NATURE10717","title":"The Amazon basin in transition","authors":[{"LN":"Davidson","FN":"E."},{"LN":"Araùjo","FN":"A."},{"LN":"Artaxo","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Balch","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Brown","FN":"I."},{"LN":"Bustamante","FN":"M.

Considering the biome changes from current potential vegetation in the case when at least 75% of the calculations agree on the projected biome change (consensus), the decrease of the tropical forest area in South America is 3% for the period 2020–2029, 9% for 2050–2059 and 18% for 2090–2099 for the A2 emission scenario."},{"id":"7be1503a792568ba35e9ba65a6a98876dc2bc808","doi":"10.1007/S10236-002-0023-6","title":"The potential role of spectral properties in detecting thresholds in the Earth system: application to the thermohaline circulation","authors":[{"LN":"Kleinen","FN":"T."},{"LN":"Held","FN":"H."},{"LN":"Petschel-Held","FN":"G."}],"year":2003,"journal":"","references":["05e3c5821b4b83e641cab124fbf1487ba3e510fd","0f10d1728128773edea2ecc3033fa493b46e7aa6","1c702ed336db8f9ca88573dbc5dbb665ae006c0d","1cd3146bd060e4a18f4a850f622c14546a6f38e7","394c4c3dcc3384274b3698f1e45798f910317d7d","3a721e687753711835f840ee4cba634ef5c442b7","3c1b228664e9510176dc05620e9a50cfa0404c5b","42914d64da7a84b9d763d8e57b25b4a6ca628c54","4291ea0a22be2a6afc45026c869857abc8ee80ed","53003677ba3551efef6c518efb5b74ac5eca68ca","5b8e2f045426c687851ae959e7ddc38ae5548c06","66337323c6a5e6d80bc6e801df33f99a7102c713","6d6e8f615e931d756be11821788429a6cce0c196","703c85dc4987c014c1a23a0b4b6974b556829ccd","704cc252b6aeffb27227ad40d6a7c9e771d756b1","7a1d8f9d99fb5fae67fbdd1936e97fe4507bc1f1","82400aa057e200cc72ee9ed9021dce4c5e464cca","8d4b4f4a9deedd22b9c04bf9b7c7a6cd3b2da3cd","9ae6623c0cec2832a8c9b6def85655c48becad6c","a7ea0feb5809cfcdcbe2f0f2c0b4db9e1cadc895","ae24213e213c8a3b6ec752c62ebc0d14595808fb","becaba5915403b0ef3e2fbff73b0d4fadaa99c75","bf573edbba89ec78f577c569832f2d2e36d84a61","c076a09e667635f2ccaa3cd36b9cc4ca0258cd7b","cf77467430cf373385ac5c09507b36000f3cf168","d552886fb08cdb2ea48e41f0f5cbdc2d3f2b96d6","e0e8ced769c7c03f8bb27bf24b1573d2b49b7665","e61d4075a967e668b9bd07c02a9a10580854d966","eeb16f043265f14097c73160fd81faedb5cc04ee","faa8d78e3cbb1f1e814a2808c56f8d08f0a06c74","fb0f84092776169eb2afde1c08c884b7100f14b2","fd794aac5f2592fde6146aa2c8618fba7e38754f","ffec6b958f89ee996372c36b0aaf8f90bdc09fe2",null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citations":[],"citationsCount":178,"abstract":"Abstract A simple two-box model of the hemispheric thermohaline circulation (THC) is considered.

Five of the eleven models predict an increase of annual rainfall, three models predict a decrease of rainfall, and the other three models predict no significant changes in the Amazon rainfall. We have further examined two models. The UKMO-HadCM3 model predicts an El Nino-like sea surface temperature (SST) change and warming in the northern tropical Atlantic which appear to enhance atmospheric subsidence and consequently reduce clouds over the Amazon. The resultant increase of surface solar absorption causes a stronger surface sensible heat flux and thus reduces relative humidity of the surface air. These changes decrease the rate and length of wet season rainfall and surface latent heat flux. This decreased wet season rainfall leads to drier soil during the subsequent dry season, which in turn can delay the transition from the dry to wet season. GISS-ER predicts a weaker SST warming in the western Pacific and the southern tropical Atlantic which increases moisture transport and hence rainfall in the Amazon. In the southern Amazon and Nordeste where the strongest rainfall increase occurs, the resultant higher soil moisture supports a higher surface latent heat flux during the dry and transition season and leads to an earlier wet season onset."},{"id":"697b3c5a9a2e157e3fa325c040ebd16680e0ea00","doi":"10.1126/SCIENCE.1210657","title":"Global Resilience of Tropical Forest and Savanna to Critical Transitions","authors":[{"LN":"Hirota","FN":"M."},{"LN":"Holmgren","FN":"M."},{"LN":"Nes","FN":"E.

So far, evidence for this idea has remained elusive, and integrated climate models assume smooth vegetation responses. We analyzed data on the distribution of tree cover in Africa, Australia, and South America to reveal strong evidence for the existence of three distinct attractors: forest, savanna, and a treeless state. Empirical reconstruction of the basins of attraction indicates that the resilience of the states varies in a universal way with precipitation.

Water levels of major Amazon tributaries fell drastically to unprecedented low values, and isolated the floodplain population whose transportation depends upon on local streams which completely dried up. The drought of 2010 in Amazonia started in early austral summer during El Nino and then was intensified as a consequence of the warming of the tropical North Atlantic. An observed tendency for an increase in dry and very dry events, particularly in southern Amazonia during the dry season, is concomitant with an increase in the length of the dry season. Our results suggest that it is by means of a longer dry season that warming in the tropical North Atlantic affects the hydrology of the Amazon Rivers at the end of the recession period (austral spring).

Rising atmospheric CO2 is found to contribute 20% to the precipitation reduction through the physiological forcing of stomatal closure, with 80% of the reduction being seen when stomatal closure was excluded and only radiative forcing by CO2 was included. The forest dieback exerts two positive feedbacks on the precipitation reduction; a biogeophysical feedback through reduced forest cover suppressing local evaporative water recycling, and a biogeochemical feedback through the release of CO2 contributing to an accelerated global warming. The precipitation reduction is enhanced by 20% by the biogeophysical feedback, and 5% by the carbon cycle feedback from the forest dieback. This analysis helps to explain why the Amazonian precipitation reduction simulated by HadCM3LC is more extreme than that simulated in other GCMs; in the fully-coupled, climate-carbon cycle simulation, approximately half of the precipitation reduction in Amazonia is attributable to a combination of physiological forcing and biogeophysical and global carbon cycle feedbacks, which are generally not included in other GCM simulations of future climate change. The analysis also demonstrates the potential contribution of regional-scale climate and ecosystem change to uncertainties in global CO2 and climate change projections. Moreover, the importance of feedbacks suggests that a human-induced increase in forest vulnerability to climate change may have implications for regional and global scale climate sensitivity."},{"id":"da3b009864e1f75e882f3713a50e0de7bd977aa9","doi":"10.1890/06-1046.1","title":"Mortality of large trees and lianas following experimental drought in an Amazon forest.","authors":[{"LN":"Nepstad","FN":"D."},{"LN":"Tohver","FN":"I."},{"LN":"Ray","FN":"David G."},{"LN":"Moutinho","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Cardinot","FN":"G."}],"year":2007,"journal":"Ecology","references":["03a2141c87b8aeaebc0418a2de7521ab938b8f24","03dce724658242a3d832eeb209873552a04741cd","05db0efd9d655d92aa895e4e1544bb76593401e1","086b6041fdf108ddad98d3750930bf661ff7aa5a","118eb2b2952efb64f7cac27ceb223e55e21dfb83","1bd03649787e349a26cb59e04f0c84c90e2e9e99","1d102c625fe13dcf341e9db2f21fcf9e2d7b60ac","272505afe4f4cc01b636727abf7ea486d755824a","27d7ba7187c52ce4533e0b5e019f2b9b71d135c1","3000567f2417c5fa6dd0eff8c7bc5bfb48056b47","31f0d0e31a9e3b88ce1a255ff28e78a9ace286fa","3d1269afae180ddaaca266673fc23ef403192c52","3ebcdd655c5b377efda440b1ba2b4adf13516ed9","450460a1fa0aa0809797aaac341e64e28df526a6","453dd174d548599f058efface4502458d8f8c977","462c980809b9a63704afcc53bd95fd27790506bd","47d2fa4504dc29955cc48c7dcffbdbbb38a17781","4a31feb8468936a9bb3246196bcff5a3bc2d0c99","5cfc9d3a5e49ad09099b11bc4fc9887823fddded","614f0a07eab4d3240918acda9ca6180b58e89b19","62962cc69c4a80e75146684cef220429a9391d8e","6a36ffd49c3c52e88a17dec733e04da08a771708","7402647b1799246dc7e5a8a5e3ef16e51ce67d50","741af4a286a431e2f08da3e9d8ef80531284e73e","7c3a1010b860e276391a86d4116bf90c8c8df25e","82deac8154fd7c2ce1e7d96df35f686338209d48","8b6aea30cfe710aeb54b8da1736c095ae32c6ee3","93650a0353ebb2c55825fd957730920d5c529717","950ee4568b6d603b34ab7ca4cfdebd5a1313045b","9922c947c51e05c0bdcf78ad227e8a66d60a722b","9a2452bfd0f6f1f00a9a2ae06ecd847c4e4bb344","9c7623d015cb47012792dce79c3ceaa1fd78da23","9d4dab5a9546e45356b00f3ea3ecd98974513a56","a637f09be32f8ff15cf16b60321aaa74cb208ac1","adeb1fbf482c6c9b4b1b2593d7ff733b93869c27","b5bb50e56ddfc66f746a34a749a92a489d43d975","b6b24918cdec494c9b7dc4a49b885a39572e0807","ba672766a0b100f0959fe0424abb85c77aa752ec","bab94380d61e2886ba58a9a748069ad8701ccb56","bfb40b3517466513e5bd8bcbf879fe26983972d2","bfe62521cb27b66555b2541fa46e4c1d50bed617","c2ec8646cc967c00b00f24d24d847c72bef1fec4","c409ab496b3a306a9e14c730c898d63a7ac171f2","cfeccc984fb6f710d29551fdc7bba9969e470953","d2fb1620988b540a243b2e4a25984f7eb84b0328","dd1bb4e85133c9a51149d1a5d10bb6ff2e595b9b","e0e5f217b9f766ffffa08c64362618c4ff266b06","e15a7365cfaa86b419d1abefc8c68000bdcd850f","e6bd9186e04dd9428235a08a497417c4731b2735","e8d4605c2996f84489c574e5cac68e604cfb9ed0","f1c3a1d7fcf252b763ccbad39722dca7b3c7cc51","f9fb9378cde985eb2b1236bfe26b1ffc3f760f3a","fbfb5fb4646201931a819cb96a7b7971a45de5ca","fe3b20cf5e742dc1f885086346ecbaf187ced4e1",null,null,null,null,null,null],"citations":[],"citationsCount":554,"abstract":"Severe drought episodes such as those associated with El Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events influence large areas of tropical forest and may become more frequent in the future. One of the most important forest responses to severe drought is tree mortality, which alters forest structure, composition, carbon content, and flammability, and which varies widely. This study tests the hypothesis that tree mortality increases abruptly during drought episodes when plant-available soil water (PAW) declines below a critical minimum threshold. It also examines the effect of tree size, plant life form (palm, liana, tree) and potential canopy position (understory, midcanopy, overstory) on drought-induced plant mortality. A severe, four-year drought episode was simulated by excluding 60% of incoming throughfall during each wet season using plastic panels installed in the understory of a 1-ha forest treatment plot, while a 1-ha control plot received normal rainfall. After 3.2 years, the treatment resulted in a 38% increase in mortality rates across all stems >2 cm dbh. Mortality rates increased 4.5-fold among large trees (>30 cm dbh) and twofold among medium trees (10-30 cm dbh) in response to the treatment, whereas the smallest stems were less responsive. Recruitment rates did not compensate for the elevated mortality of larger-diameter stems in the treatment plot. Overall, lianas proved more susceptible to drought-induced mortality than trees or palms, and potential overstory tree species were more vulnerable than midcanopy and understory species. Large stems contributed to 90% of the pretreatment live aboveground biomass in both plots. Large-tree mortality resulting from the treatment generated 3.4 times more dead biomass than the control plot. The dramatic mortality response suggests significant, adverse impacts on the global carbon cycle if climatic changes follow current trends."},{"id":"faa8d78e3cbb1f1e814a2808c56f8d08f0a06c74","doi":"10.1038/35098000","title":"Catastrophic shifts in ecosystems","authors":[{"LN":"Scheffer","FN":"M."},{"LN":"Carpenter","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Foley","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Folke","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Walker","FN":"B."}],"year":2001,"journal":"Nature","references":["0043cf9ba569181bd72305fa6989e22dd352c6b8","0fe9f2dcd9fdd337000fbff03955f3110f3d16ee","1f0a454d007c1c8760701c2212f3a820a978652b","22bf6bccf7da09e60943040beebcdb2f2a0ff840","27562e9674ff9477083d814710cf67b55989e09f","28f3c2b7ee4159e9caa9693c3e83169b2ae202a1","2c15962f29fee1b4ddb3c98e6bfca874b1b3d1f8","2ebcfb9367eca573653c0cc3d4ba2b0b1158c61f","34bde25920a0a8940e47d4a5dac4f1baa5ba78b9","35c99c1d463bf1206c6864a3edc617368c4b18a8","3808ab79b5f673b95addf0c2ddd82f9545ccc0f3","3c377c57ae4979a27b47f156914d0b0c29ad09f2","40dc2c48d96413fa567d3084237263c0fe6e2a14","41fae3dd99ca8ae6205554350792639671c63d68","462aeab741bbc41f63b2a5e42e18416e568a2d35","479a7482f79a853bdd5825429d72eea62f171605","48e2cb2ba8864ca3a5938a32a0383eaaa50969c0","4eb0de30b5935ff2d4eeba91db003984c36776bd","5363f1a3d5c2c8b87d6b3168804102e0e9cc5cec","5ee6b7c319e472c604826829683266b7562b5af6","617c50e9bc65ee8c3da9363534504db88700ef57","63b1c013c4838eb69c27be5bf79699bb9d6f2c33","6557f1264403523d480b6eaaef0ab528d6d9e4b0","68527a257b1b194d5f6a962720de66557c5306a2","6a4fcd23e0a5a61e4a522922a0e34173e77b0c17","7125f9131232c07be3be5b8190cb4d2c326222f3","764163bbc58ef90d65799c77233fb89a012fcb0b","7f331a5952de8502721c4f5c5e7626b14001b995","833133de92889e4b2efb212354e499b801112296","86870ac23c84ec73d1842aed174059b5eaf1f3b3","886ca9420e3b333d16812001404e8c63e2758d1c","8d4b4f4a9deedd22b9c04bf9b7c7a6cd3b2da3cd","8ef45c9e71ec1858272a3e77e9122890cecd809f","94bc5ac46b4fd502c228401381fe1709541b6962","9953b41993c7d18ffb08f4754774375ae9329382","9d7464421e53cf19562ea9d79be05f1f8e1c5fc0","a90b3cc5a5ad6d60fa737b11f6764c5ce53a9629","aa853f35baa24ce78f740fba9956a61f6044fcc6","bbeb0f88937a5856c7697cd2565d1c4e46fee30d","bf1342b105538a96fd8b421dcda7a666cfb75001","c6e9198028499caf405d5d7a484de80b3ba56291","ce09069d25ff87618deb80b11fce1c594e0a8dcb","cee65351097b56449b712fe43ad155a4e842edbc","d1c96e134f6d8831154f7866609ee63b4e9e6a54","d571963a597742e6aa80f43db9446517501b3e20","d5734180b82d82179f75e94e566ca854acf0bf80","d60d316e8f8bbaf86b6841d54e5b1b1e18f9dfb3","dad162182e5f4e9f86ab59a3393ad687523ffcb8","e03aa06a095320a432b7e03ac622a4f34dc13e69","e415038575b84918414f8973acff6a399a8b66f2","e66f329da01aa25bc836a58ddb8aaad6b038e341","e86fd30425407b651f6644629faf4b68140abd1c","edc1547c4b074638bc38fd898aa9ea52c77bc645","f80ab2226cc7e7ac093462ce19258c56ef773d31","fe1fc2beaba3b431be58ef73ea8c1ee6cb69cb32","fe3c857107548cb60b08406460ea4160a9d15ba1",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citations":[],"citationsCount":5721,"abstract":"All ecosystems are exposed to gradual changes in climate, nutrient loading, habitat fragmentation or biotic exploitation.

Estimates of the sensitivity of the terrestrial carbon budget to climate anomalies in the tropics and the identification of the mechanisms responsible for feedback effects remain uncertain. The Amazon basin stores a vast amount of carbon, and has experienced increasingly higher temperatures and more frequent floods and droughts over the past two decades. Here we report seasonal and annual carbon balances across the Amazon basin, based on carbon dioxide and carbon monoxide measurements for the anomalously dry and wet years 2010 and 2011, respectively. We find that the Amazon basin lost 0.48 ± 0.18 petagrams of carbon per year (Pg C yr−1) during the dry year but was carbon neutral (0.06 ± 0.1 Pg C yr−1) during the wet year. Taking into account carbon losses from fire by using carbon monoxide measurements, we derived the basin net biome exchange (that is, the carbon flux between the non-burned forest and the atmosphere) revealing that during the dry year, vegetation was carbon neutral. During the wet year, vegetation was a net carbon sink of 0.25 ± 0.14 Pg C yr−1, which is roughly consistent with the mean long-term intact-forest biomass sink of 0.39 ± 0.10 Pg C yr−1 previously estimated from forest censuses. Observations from Amazonian forest plots suggest the suppression of photosynthesis during drought as the primary cause for the 2010 sink neutralization. Overall, our results suggest that moisture has an important role in determining the Amazonian carbon balance. If the recent trend of increasing precipitation extremes persists, the Amazon may become an increasing carbon source as a result of both emissions from fires and the suppression of net biome exchange by drought."},{"id":"d5ceb141c709ab0d6d74e41fe93aa06099bbd9fe","doi":"10.1088/1748-9326/7/2/024002","title":"High sensitivity of future global warming to land carbon cycle processes","authors":[{"LN":"Booth","FN":"B."},{"LN":"Jones","FN":"Chris D."},{"LN":"Collins","FN":"M."},{"LN":"Totterdell","FN":"I."},{"LN":"Cox","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Sitch","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Huntingford","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Betts","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Harris","FN":"G."},{"LN":"Lloyd","FN":"J."}],"year":2012,"journal":"","references":["0aa3fbfcaf2ab6201c68a925fd7e87bd9dbedc32","0f00d8cf849e98b27334880aa29c87dc5f0e8071","1563068db0707d4cedcc14b4de057ab117fbed50","1a4b301567b6c7115d113dee6dcc8867284db58c","30541301ceb8aa7dac01fe45e36f3db90d2fb332","32ba576f5e4b180064fbe3b3b60f19f9e648f644","3f6de1058b23b4c3133b1011ae2fb657c06cb34f","489f90d0d5a39190824a2177b914ecd6ea9298f3","55404bc3b0bc58a6cb92914a1b79fbb4bcb57839","57abe065e7a158c03a875485471d02ff056a0f10","6b1567bd4fddce64d24d86da2ab8f5cd27a830bb","71a56116bc4f294463bb4863ac33087556df3ed3","783a5fb8634f1a395bd46fc85c2c5403112f7572","794d985c9f7bbbf90e6b05306ee8c7bc221e7af1","79f5347aee431eaf7c1ca95405950a2a4ef19a41","7ba33b812df45064ab0ddda8059a9da4258ffb1e","7ca23f2237be9ccf2738dcdab93fbbe83b36bfa2","80fffe67f434082e9f06b3ca25df8be83270eb91","8215586be96d7872d1d4903266f8553f16e38cce","a0aa0a7583b54b4e1327b7f390d07d9f1fff45a0","a2f0a879e115b594219c1767854366b56462dd27","ae24f493fed5ba9cede11c8e5805e9dc00fc3522","ae5279bb27111a348c59a80d3da8dc1138363973","b15964d388efb9e558a01d1b9a1ef5135bdfcabc","b214624cfd3764c091804c73ed213d4f85f03cba","bfb40b3517466513e5bd8bcbf879fe26983972d2","c0a44f5316a0160fdc7b32156574b7a87b562ac0","c17ad0f3224b43afadd3aaac7eb3be82efb503f3","cfc1a3fbd2fe229045e0c53f7f9609e80ab3f8d5","d5f43498f775161d0c194acf33bece3d5a9e3584","da470d86e7e3e8203f8f32b6fc86525ec1474785","eb6fe72a49d384ccddce7a3aa992573975981fe7","ef8ca175b43705f0a54c3e6f0401eb1734b08a25","f16719263ea1ac975299e02c92db596f809bd841","f28bd82538c4cc6af7df2e06f9196b9506f9912f",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citations":[],"citationsCount":232,"abstract":"Unknowns in future global warming are usually assumed to arise from uncertainties either in the amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions or in the sensitivity of the climate to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations. Characterizing the additional uncertainty in relating CO2 emissions to atmospheric concentrations has relied on either a small number of complex models with diversity in process representations, or simple models. To date, these models indicate that the relevant carbon cycle uncertainties are smaller than the uncertainties in physical climate feedbacks and emissions. Here, for a single emissions scenario, we use a full coupled climate–carbon cycle model and a systematic method to explore uncertainties in the land carbon cycle feedback. We find a plausible range of climate–carbon cycle feedbacks significantly larger than previously estimated. Indeed the range of CO2 concentrations arising from our single emissions scenario is greater than that previously estimated across the full range of IPCC SRES emissions scenarios with carbon cycle uncertainties ignored. The sensitivity of photosynthetic metabolism to temperature emerges as the most important uncertainty. This highlights an aspect of current land carbon modelling where there are open questions about the potential role of plant acclimation to increasing temperatures. There is an urgent need for better understanding of plant photosynthetic responses to high temperature, as these responses are shown here to be key contributors to the magnitude of future change."},{"id":"85859541f542a9526e3b4579683f4090388be102","doi":"10.1073/PNAS.0601816103","title":"A climate-change risk analysis for world ecosystems","authors":[{"LN":"Scholze","FN":"M."},{"LN":"Knorr","FN":"W."},{"LN":"Arnell","FN":"N."},{"LN":"Prentice","FN":"I."}],"year":2006,"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences","references":["0148f1e022383592d314103166b78b1f35dd7dd0","02ad55ab9c2da90c87c0358508d39f5ce681d844","1827e1ac90edc282812ee0e08b411aba4f2b52b1","1f0fdc714e51ada17239a001998d45e9fd3e4f46","2174a398f9114b7694760775603087ca8daaa413","24d47214f7a1531feb868441a27a09b7fda3d5e4","2bf17cd351027f7ca53a062f8f72d97f2e483ef2","38cda3f2f787ce00ec33388ba2f7fad762df4bdc","3f7ddb2e4008889177a6462757b6f1cbd3e66533","50df61e884fa27a5a914816a3e75a55a3973ffc7","54053b0b9b7b5bc27065f9ef0c40da16fa2c087a","6a52210e92dd7833910724c384f90d3ed77e90df","71a17d8cdc57eb96a1df2f147ca1262cc4581642","774e8d544542686c58c1be0ab913a070246d815a","8779f54b5414c0d45f230fcc3dc8efde743284ad","91b10627ba8acb5cb4b7a2bca2eba6fe7be446a7","9637a5442e5a093043b2ee8afdb2c8f149e54308","9c7623d015cb47012792dce79c3ceaa1fd78da23","9edcfabd6fd50a5dd9b2de5949176bda83ef8869","a28491ea523c244239626bef166f680b76b51878","ac4136bcb89d271ccf60da2185c0917e1f7aadcf","b473fd7ea0d021f335b8086c395d18ac152ee8b1","bf1d0f059695e2f81df488f9e85844cca44590b6","c7a059992195b414f716e1c7a84a84c6dc227145","da8999391916548eb8730db499e8c61143f92f88","e2b05f861b12a32c0c27f82242c5c45f5e48026d","e475778212bb76a86cdbce2bb01d5b2f4d7ce4e8","f0425e2b8925f3f963eccfe680d8e6e02c28d7f0","f8ead64037802ba101b509499b004e2e7cd6a0dc","fdf08ada775a8d3346d85fe9efc891b8e0cdf643","fe4ae2bd0cf62ece4b265e4d09fea56c3c6b3aa5","fedd542a6c24f5dc2fc3b5cf8391326a605ccf85","fefb31334eafeb347441412de022aae02bc7e373",null,null,null],"citations":[],"citationsCount":662,"abstract":"We quantify the risks of climate-induced changes in key ecosystem processes during the 21st century by forcing a dynamic global vegetation model with multiple scenarios from 16 climate models and mapping the proportions of model runs showing forest/nonforest shifts or exceedance of natural variability in wildfire frequency and freshwater supply. Our analysis does not assign probabilities to scenarios or weights to models. Instead, we consider distribution of outcomes within three sets of model runs grouped by the amount of global warming they simulate: <2°C (including simulations in which atmospheric composition is held constant, i.e., in which the only climate change is due to greenhouse gases already emitted), 2–3°C, and >3°C. High risk of forest loss is shown for Eurasia, eastern China, Canada, Central America, and Amazonia, with forest extensions into the Arctic and semiarid savannas; more frequent wildfire in Amazonia, the far north, and many semiarid regions; more runoff north of 50°N and in tropical Africa and northwestern South America; and less runoff in West Africa, Central America, southern Europe, and the eastern U.S. Substantially larger areas are affected for global warming >3°C than for <2°C; some features appear only at higher warming levels. A land carbon sink of ≈1 Pg of C per yr is simulated for the late 20th century, but for >3°C this sink converts to a carbon source during the 21st century (implying a positive climate feedback) in 44% of cases. The risks continue increasing over the following 200 years, even with atmospheric composition held constant."},{"id":"8a331f5a3e5ee466fd8920ab57f3b08f67cf2843","doi":"10.1038/NATURE04389","title":"Modelling conservation in the Amazon basin","authors":[{"LN":"Soares-Filho","FN":"B."},{"LN":"Nepstad","FN":"D."},{"LN":"Curran","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Cerqueira","FN":"G."},{"LN":"Garcia","FN":"R."},{"LN":"Ramos","FN":"Claudia Azevedo"},{"LN":"Voll","FN":"E."},{"LN":"McDonald","FN":"A."},{"LN":"Lefebvre","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Schlesinger","FN":"P."}],"year":2006,"journal":"Nature","references":["0829e5289bdfd095a515338a9d51fc0969fc3695","118349aee01a3db2bdae7b80ce1c7bd029a17acc","232ada4d2f06b63a64ad58c1fe5056ce26e7a2ac","24ad0ab663766a08ee9001b58d725b2af5d3862a","2a8480d74f1e7b8d623b921247c338503687ecd7","2f28ec97ea8da07b0295673755039e5ae0807179","3d727588808370b161b59e385e470c522a98998a","459ee19c9e39df89c7b5e3c34f9a67198d05de17","4a31feb8468936a9bb3246196bcff5a3bc2d0c99","5155cb75d632fdb536d8ff8db09dfed8dcca0ca2","5e4242d6c97f2754d29b3512ca1262b2fd528877","614f0a07eab4d3240918acda9ca6180b58e89b19","8e031986ce4e98d999dc0db3eb852b93e4eee1ad","92a24829f961882321f07a5147856eb137f62ca2","9378f7e422278a29e08729c6f7f586dcaf9ab6b0","962933a6a4587660056787ef898110037181380a","a0f2b6dc9485391480f37fd44639bb39b8ab5e35","a8ee4ef420c2c6a90ee221bcb74b1663e111675c","b23d41a477872dfa02d54e86d50b64a00c9969fd","b2be06e856a8b57a18a23bffe4b8bfa1157ba08a","c30a0ec8a6ca68ff52053fe3be6bae5eda0d0c5a","e2e299c708a72d3100663ff7029252397ca90ed1","ed03ec4d3059f12746f245befe3137784a027d87","f59387151a120db9f9c09eec78fc657e83a5eacd",null,null,null,null,null,null],"citations":[],"citationsCount":1185,"abstract":"Expansion of the cattle and soy industries in the Amazon basin has increased deforestation rates and will soon push all-weather highways into the region's core. In the face of this growing pressure, a comprehensive conservation strategy for the Amazon basin should protect its watersheds, the full range of species and ecosystem diversity, and the stability of regional climates. Here we report that protected areas in the Amazon basin—the central feature of prevailing conservation approaches—are an important but insufficient component of this strategy, based on policy-sensitive simulations of future deforestation. By 2050, current trends in agricultural expansion will eliminate a total of 40% of Amazon forests, including at least two-thirds of the forest cover of six major watersheds and 12 ecoregions, releasing 32 ± 8 Pg of carbon to the atmosphere. One-quarter of the 382 mammalian species examined will lose more than 40% of the forest within their Amazon ranges. Although an expanded and enforced network of protected areas could avoid as much as one-third of this projected forest loss, conservation on private lands is also essential. Expanding market pressures for sound land management and prevention of forest clearing on lands unsuitable for agriculture are critical ingredients of a strategy for comprehensive conservation."}],"outgoingSuggestions":[{"id":"999461fe8ba81918be0c0bbac1a532ec04a319bf","title":"Early warning signals of environmental tipping

The Amazonian tropical forests have been disappearing at a fast rate in the last 50 y due to deforestation to open areas for agriculture, posing high risks of irreversible changes to biodiversity and ecosystems. Climate change poses additional risks to the stability of the forests. Studies suggest “tipping points” not to be transgressed: 4° C of global warming or 40% of total deforested area. The regional development debate has focused on attempting to reconcile maximizing conservation with intensification of traditional agriculture. Large reductions of deforestation in the last decade open up opportunities for an alternative model based on seeing the Amazon as a global public good of biological assets for the creation of high-value products and ecosystem services. For half a century, the process of economic integration of the Amazon has been based on intensive use of renewable and nonrenewable natural resources, which has brought significant basin-wide environmental alterations. The rural development in the Amazonia pushed the agricultural frontier swiftly, resulting in widespread land-cover change, but agriculture in the Amazon has been of low productivity and unsustainable. The loss of biodiversity and continued deforestation will lead to high risks of irreversible change of its tropical forests. It has been established by modeling studies that the Amazon may have two “tipping points,” namely, temperature increase of 4 °C or deforestation exceeding 40% of the forest area. If transgressed, large-scale “savannization” of mostly southern and eastern Amazon may take place. The region has warmed about 1 °C over the last 60 y, and total deforestation is reaching 20% of the forested area. The recent significant reductions in deforestation—80% reduction in the Brazilian Amazon in the last decade—opens up opportunities for a novel sustainable development paradigm for the future of the Amazon. We argue for a new development paradigm—away from only attempting to reconcile maximizing conservation versus intensification of traditional agriculture and expansion of hydropower capacity—in which we research, develop, and scale a high-tech innovation approach that sees the Amazon as a global public good of biological assets that can enable the creation of innovative high-value products, services, and platforms through combining advanced digital, biological, and material technologies of the Fourth Industrial Revolution in

on the possibility of future abrupt climate change has been popularized under the term ‘tipping points’ and has often been motivated by using simple, low-dimensional concepts. These include the iconic fold bifurcation, where abrupt change occurs when a stable equilibrium is lost, and early warning signals of such a destabilization that can be derived based on a simple stochastic model approach. In this paper, we review the challenges and limitations that are associated with this view, and we discuss promising research paths to explore the causes and the likelihood of abrupt changes in future climate. We focus on several climate system components and ecosystems that have been proposed as candidates for tipping points, with an emphasis on ice sheets, the Atlantic Ocean circulation, vegetation in North Africa and Arctic sea ice. In most example cases, multiple equilibria found in simple models do not appear in complex models or become more difficult to find, while the potential for abrupt change still remains. We also discuss how the low-dimensional logic of current methods to detect and interpret the existence of multiple equilibria can fail in complex models. Moreover, we highlight promising methods to detect abrupt shifts and to obtain information about the mechanisms behind them. These methods include linear approaches such as statistical stability indicators and radiative feedback analysis as well as non-linear approaches to detect dynamical transitions and infer the causality behind events. Given the huge complexity of comprehensive process-based climate models and the non-linearity and regional peculiarities of the processes involved, the uncertainties associated with the possible future occurrence of abrupt shifts are large and not well quantified. We highlight the potential of data mining approaches to tackle this problem and finally discuss how the scientific community can collaborate to make efficient progress in understanding abrupt climate shifts."},{"id":"0554f1ec84933bfcc22ce68f1562258ebfddb461","doi":"10.7287/PEERJ.PREPRINTS.26646V1","title":"Growing aridity and seasonality can drive catastrophic changes in the Amazon forest","authors":[{"LN":"Anjos","FN":"L.

However, the ecological mechanisms underlying these potential events are still poorly understood. Here, we investigate the mechanism responsible for controlling the forest-savanna transition regime through an objective measure of resilience, based on the multidimensional climatic niche of ecosystems. Our results suggest that there is an alternating dominance, where forest and savanna have their respective basins of attraction. However, we note that the two stable states can coexist only in a narrow ecotonal zone of bistability. In this particular region, there is an equivalence between forest and savanna in quantitative terms and its presence indicates, in addition to a low hysteresis, a propensity for a catastrophic transition regime between forest and savanna. In this sense, we determine the critical levels of resilience that intermediate the dynamics of transition between forest and savanna through such bistable ecotonal zone. Also, we found that bistable region is strongly associated with critical climatic thresholds, mainly on the axis of the moisture availability and climatic seasonality, but with the lower effect of the average annual temperature. Thus, we can expect that if such climatic thresholds are reached, due to ongoing climate change, and forest resilience limits are exceeded; largescale catastrophic events will suddenly be triggered. The expected effects are the erosion of Amazonian biodiversity, with the massive extinction of species, culminating in the consolidation of a stable state with simplified ecosystems, with a lower

Increasing attention is focusing upon climate tipping elements – large-scale earth systems anticipated to respond through positive feedbacks to anthropogenic climate change by shifting towards new long-term states. In some but not all cases, such changes could produce additional greenhouse gas emissions or radiative forcing that could compound global warming. Developing greater understanding of tipping elements is important for predicting future climate risks. Here we review mechanisms, predictions, impacts, and knowledge gaps associated with ten notable climate tipping elements. We also evaluate which tipping elements are more imminent and whether shifts will likely manifest rapidly or over longer timescales. Some tipping elements are significant to future global climate and will likely affect major ecosystems, climate patterns, and/or carbon cycling within the current century. However, assessments under different emissions scenarios indicate a strong potential to reduce or avoid impacts associated with many tipping elements through climate change mitigation. Most tipping elements do not possess the potential for abrupt future change within years, and some tipping elements are perhaps more accurately termed climate feedbacks. Nevertheless, significant uncertainties remain associated with many tipping elements, highlighting an acute need for further research and modeling to better constrain risks."},{"id":"2e1136b8fc4f2f085f78a2c55cee6861e65ab21e","doi":"10.3389/FFGC.2021.618401","title":"Carbon and Beyond: The Biogeochemistry of Climate in a Rapidly Changing Amazon","authors":[{"LN":"Covey","FN":"K."},{"LN":"Soper","FN":"F."},{"LN":"Pangala","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Bernardino","FN":"A."},{"LN":"Pagliaro","FN":"Zoe"},{"LN":"Basso","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Cassol","FN":"H."},{"LN":"Fearnside","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Navarrete","FN":"D."},{"LN":"Novoa","FN":"Sidney"},{"LN":"Sawakuchi","FN":"H."},{"LN":"Lovejoy","FN":"T."},{"LN":"Marengo","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Peres","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Baillie","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Bernasconi","FN":"P."},{"LN":"Camargo","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Freitas","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Hoffman","FN":"B."},{"LN":"Nardoto","FN":"G.

Amazon Basin is at the center of an intensifying discourse about deforestation, land-use, and global change. To date, climate research in the Basin has overwhelmingly focused on the cycling and storage of carbon (C) and its implications for global climate. Missing, however, is a more comprehensive consideration of other significant biophysical climate feedbacks [i.e., CH4, N2O, black carbon, biogenic volatile organic compounds (BVOCs), aerosols, evapotranspiration, and albedo] and their dynamic responses to both localized (fire, land-use change, infrastructure development, and storms) and global (warming, drying, and some related to El Niño or to warming in the tropical Atlantic) changes. Here, we synthesize the current understanding of (1) sources and fluxes of all major forcing agents, (2) the demonstrated or expected impact of global and local changes on each agent, and (3) the nature, extent, and drivers of anthropogenic change in the Basin. We highlight the large uncertainty in flux magnitude and responses, and their corresponding direct and indirect effects on the regional and global climate system. Despite uncertainty in their responses to change, we conclude that current warming from non-CO2 agents (especially CH4 and N2O) in the Amazon Basin largely offsets—and most likely exceeds—the climate service provided by atmospheric CO2 uptake. We also find that the majority of anthropogenic impacts act to increase the radiative forcing potential of the Basin. Given the large contribution of less-recognized agents (e.g., Amazonian trees alone emit ~3.5% of all global CH4), a continuing focus on a single metric (i.e., C uptake and storage) is incompatible with genuine efforts to understand and manage the biogeochemistry of climate in a rapidly changing Amazon Basin."},{"id":"9cecf6fef78409962a009d2e278b74e6f8307dcf","doi":"10.1029/2020EF001608","title":"Implications of CMIP6 Projected Drying Trends for 21st Century Amazonian Drought Risk","authors":[{"LN":"Parsons","FN":"L."}],"year":2020,"journal":"","references":["0357c3f073305768efa16cb912f42822dca8d86a","05db0efd9d655d92aa895e4e1544bb76593401e1","0e0c9ae9a624920fe1560e0cdb047601e24ae84c","0f727325ebaa2007bd782be4c022dc99c1423862","12334afe89c06c07a1409d4442a1d51c26e10d93","18a64b13b75949d23931086304f9eb938ccbfba8","296bc78c86d17481e9b8983632773f3c5666b2af","2d9218def6ab501b538046314e08c1fbb51c2ad6","2dba24d0ae646a9562d1bdef3b2605325e65dc0f","2dda5d78bc9458b2a2ccd01341becb4bae35cc4b","2ef3d560d93620d057ce0fc65b07e6267a9aff31","2ef9d34209c48e9df4912882a55b7961e6b90af8","3245c96d239994d5f2ab25b41196861977cbcee6","3505426bb35ec95f9f701dd24f98e4bf43f8a827","383d9c0078ec986cad328ad6bad8e2196d6f92da","3cdf09cd704f5b999a6646a62c8d03c7e628e146","3d10dd82a59e52e1ca67a2aa5b1bfffd16340a31","48e20beab31430668cc14bceff2fb726d72ce2b8","4a14dde9a07dd2b5e07a7fa338a11db8035a2555","525319b95c1b7f3019cc7692cb51343957b69c19","53310ff68ec5d3fb85086c1c16fe942f469baa18","59a1d285aa5de669d98844821d2686bf387edb0f","5e97cc03d3bdaebe0aef3d1fac8069d4a08eb32d","5fc15dd2fcbc0eacb92514a35a756874d5364f30","706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","741af4a286a431e2f08da3e9d8ef80531284e73e","786a195589e1bc4fda8665b79e21207befe6f25d","7dca88e6a55a504c68fc3629209c000201879f80","7ece1642a1306d1a27c62938fb384c7a0ad2c95d","801571e89ba007ac22ba63f3e3fff5243f81c715","84036a744d549a751357449efa935be89d6fad65","890a85aded53b0990b1ec8f6708d8f38919aad9b","8ba176b29e3bd758d9de83945b9096f57c712bba","8be15e7f561b5bb14dd38c5dc8c66cdb48415579","8c3fdd028e07693861dc228329c27124b84eba2d","8e82e2acd75797c5fd7bc72a1ce301e1e9e69a6d","8eae17d86e6366f535382447172dfdc2b2c97bc8","8f091488e087aff5dc997d0ad71a79bf65fbf2a2","922cd02a5e4f1298384cb5b9f6d13df5daf64b70","9a5f456a1c6849e7496c1bb548c789adec037c15","9bdf8afa76c1a7fbbc0fd58e7d6abcaa2817785e","9c2edf3c71130f2c257db7ac814222fa081a6ac0","9df1184653b0f6ff0839b0839a44a803ae2268b9","a010b76e1a809da5a128def075a310b1b1511593","a4b6e12005d58e512712405b351ae128b5f9300f","a6bc4a16d203b6c7c69fc7420eaf13fa59a8218c","a89d33a7c14ddba9776a2cda39722917972b2103","acc59a30d83ff1a9b64e0ab38918baf635b1891d","b0cc7cc671c6b4d251d480a3dda2eb3ba79e8db1","b2106525c8abca4f0e8f05570c1e3487ee969c09","b33e5aecefd59b238fec2a8624dcce25018cd440","b40f6f5f1f5931a2f902da254405c554e3ca6b9c","bab6bc5b33dbbdd580f67e679683b0d328ec280b","c1791bd941e8abcc2507fefc44ffe0a389f5aa58","c5d1cae1051791b37d57974825c341269571ce99","ca581be02883dccc681763aacf95d44fc8f6d41a","cd36d4c2e7355b8446d3cdf70dc7a6413267ea84","cf7739be532fff698dfce2c2738f2c2259ce414b","d1700f180eeddb9bb47cba2c93fb641719951d12","d2d1c5b6db0a49162e26cbe3681aba5746dac515","d4be1024e3d1151fa6b6bf8dc9863184c30e0589","d7b4a30c881f74acf8eae8cf4ccc79ef5d0437a3","dcf63ff10dc75506bf38caf46a0eef4aaf359c62","e25e0c03b571c6a1fcf16dbee17b0fa5f625cc1c","e43256238dbfcf1fe37aac918a6d2d033e22d380","e4cdfb79958698b4f182bbb319c2c592007b1244","e6b3461e00f8dd937aaa9b05cbb1245139bc9b81","e78b4774a2805e803f368ce219f8de92d4f8fb89","f6507ca951e61214c9268ce9a43376724b2f9bcf","f7629d88403e22cde5c0f3f5b3df7e0a9623b7b9",null,null,null],"citations":[],"citationsCount":7,"abstract":"Recent exceptionally hot droughts in Amazonia have highlighted the potential role of global warming in driving elevated fire risk and forest dieback.

and drought are among the greatest environmental pressures on the Amazon rainforest, possibly destabilizing the forest-climate system. Deforestation in the Amazon reduces rainfall regionally, while this deforestation itself has been reported to be facilitated by droughts. Here we quantify the interactions between drought and deforestation spatially across the Amazon during the early 21st century. First, we relate observed fluctuations in deforestation rates to dry-season intensity; second, we determine the effect of conversion of forest to cropland on evapotranspiration; and third, we simulate the subsequent downwind reductions in rainfall due to decreased atmospheric water input. We find large variability in the response of deforestation to dry-season intensity, with a significant but small average increase in deforestation rates with a more intense dry season: With every mm of water deficit, deforestation tends to increase by 0.13% per year. Deforestation, in turn, has caused an estimated 4% of the recent observed drying, with the south-western part of the Amazon being most strongly affected. Combining both effects, we quantify a reinforcing drought-deforestation feedback that is currently small, but becomes gradually stronger with cumulative deforestation. Our results suggest that global climate change, not deforestation, is the main driver of recent drying in the Amazon. However, a feedback between drought and deforestation implies that increases in either of them will impede efforts to curb both."},{"id":"b6509639aad527d5203381c56850eef410542a2e","title":"Recent

uncertainties still dominate the hypothesis of an abrupt large-scale shift of the Amazon forest caused by climate change [Amazonian forest dieback (AFD)] even though observational evidence shows the forest and regional climate changing. Here, we assess whether mitigation or adaptation action should be taken now, later, or not at all in light of such uncertainties. No action/later action would result in major social impacts that may influence migration to large Amazonian cities through a causal chain of climate change and forest degradation leading to lower river-water levels that affect transportation, food security, and health. Net-present value socioeconomic damage over a 30-year period after AFD is estimated between US dollar (USD) $957 billion (×109) and $3,589 billion (compared with Gross Brazilian Amazon Product of USD $150 billion per year), arising primarily from changes in the provision of ecosystem services. Costs of acting now would be one to two orders of magnitude lower than economic damages. However, while AFD mitigation alternatives—e.g., curbing deforestation—are attainable (USD $64 billion), their efficacy in achieving a forest resilience that prevents AFD is uncertain. Concurrently, a proposed set of 20 adaptation measures is also attainable (USD $122 billion) and could bring benefits even if AFD never occurs. An interdisciplinary research agenda to fill lingering knowledge gaps and constrain the risk of AFD should focus on developing sound experimental and modeling evidence regarding its likelihood, integrated with socioeconomic assessments to anticipate its impacts and evaluate the feasibility and efficacy of mitigation/adaptation

article reviews recent scientific progress, relating to four major systems that could exhibit threshold behaviour: ice sheets, the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), tropical forests and ecosystem responses to ocean acidification. The focus is on advances since the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change Fifth Assessment Report (IPCC AR5). The most significant developments in each component are identified by synthesizing input from multiple experts from each field. For ice sheets, some degree of irreversible loss (timescales of millennia) of part of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) may have already begun, but the rate and eventual magnitude of this irreversible loss is uncertain. The observed AMOC overturning has decreased from 2004–2014, but it is unclear at this stage whether this is forced or is internal variability. New evidence from experimental and natural droughts has given greater confidence that tropical forests are adversely affected by drought. The ecological and socio-economic impacts of ocean acidification are expected to greatly increase over the range from today’s annual value of around 400, up to 650 ppm CO2 in the atmosphere (reached around 2070 under RCP8.5), with the rapid development of aragonite undersaturation at high latitudes affecting calcifying organisms. Tropical coral reefs are vulnerable to the interaction of ocean acidification and temperature rise, and the rapidity of those changes, with severe losses and risks to survival at 2 K warming above pre-industrial levels. Across the four systems studied, however, quantitative evidence for a difference in risk between 1.5 and 2 K warming above pre-industrial levels is limited."},{"id":"5e8eea97ba1d1393d83fe660f860e913c87d0e44","doi":"10.3389/FRWA.2021.648499","title":"On the Hydroclimate-Vegetation Relationship in the Southwestern Amazon During the 2000–2019 Period","authors":[{"LN":"Gutierrez-Cori","FN":"Omar"},{"LN":"Espinoza","FN":"J."},{"LN":"Li","FN":"Laurent Z.

southern Amazonia is undergoing a major biophysical transition, involving changes in land use and regional climate. This study provides new insights on the relationship between hydroclimatic variables and vegetation conditions in the upper Madeira Basin (~1 × 106 km2). Vegetative dynamics are characterised using the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) while hydroclimatic variability is analysed using satellite-based precipitation, observed river discharge, satellite measurements of terrestrial water storage (TWS) and downward shortwave radiation (DSR). We show that the vegetation in this region varies from energy-limited to water-limited throughout the year. During the peak of the wet season (January-February), rainfall, discharge and TWS are negatively correlated with NDVI in February-April (r = −0.48 to −0.65; p < 0.05). In addition, DSR is positively correlated with NDVI (r = 0.47–0.54; p < 0.05), suggesting that the vegetation is mainly energy-limited during this period. Outside this period, these correlations are positive for rainfall, discharge and TWS (r = 0.55–0.88; p < 0.05), and negative for DSR (r = −0.47 to −0.54; p < 0.05), suggesting that vegetation depends mainly on water availability, particularly during the vegetation dry season (VDS; late June to late October). Accordantly, the total rainfall during the dry season explains around 80% of the VDS NDVI interannual variance. Considering the predominant land cover types, differences in the hydroclimate-NDVI relationship are observed. Evergreen forests (531,350 km2) remain energy-limited during the beginning of the dry season, but they become water-limited at the end of the VDS. In savannas and flooded savannas (162,850 km2), water dependence occurs months before the onset of the VDS. These differences are more evident during extreme drought years (2007, 2010, and 2011), where regional impacts on NDVI were stronger in savannas and flooded savannas (55% of the entire surface of savannas) than in evergreen forests (40%). A spatial analysis reveals that two specific areas do not show significant hydroclimatic-NDVI correlations during the dry season: (i) the eastern flank of the Andes, characterised by very wet conditions, therefore the vegetation is not water-limited, and (ii) recent deforested areas (~42,500 km2) that break the natural response in the hydroclimate-vegetation system.

observations for the Amazon Basin indicate the dry season is becoming drier and longer over recent decades. However, long-term climate data to put these trends in perspective are scarce for most of the Basin, thus hindering our understanding of spatial and temporal variability of the dry season in the Amazon region. I explored the potential of using tree ring-widths and oxygen isotopes in tree rings (d18OTR) of the floodplain tree species Macrolobium acaciifolium as a proxy for past climate conditions during the dry and transitional seasons, the growth period for floodplain trees. I sampled and analyzed wood cores of M. acaciifolium trees from floodplain forests located in western, central and southwest Amazon. M. acaciifolium presented clear ring definitions, but also frequent false rings requiring careful wood anatomic analysis and cross-dating. Despite these limitations, ring-formation dates estimated by cross-dating of ring-widths closely matched bomb-peak radiocarbon dating of tree-rings. Analysis of climate signals in ring-widths and d18OTR revealed potential for reconstruction of past dry season climate conditions, but the strength and nature of climate relationships differed between sites. Ring-width chronologies showed stronger climatic signals at sites located in smaller river catchments from western and southwestern Amazon, where the terrestrial phase of the trees coincided with the peak of the dry season. In contrast, d18OTR chronologies showed stronger climatic signals at the sites in western and central Amazon where growing conditions/seasons are wetter. Long-term increases in d18OTR since 1970 suggest there has been a drying trend during the dry season of the Amazon Basin, consistent with climate observations for this period. This Thesis shows that floodplain trees growing at sites in smaller catchments with mild dry seasons have the greatest potential as proxies for dry season climate. More studies exploring potentials of different floodplain species, including slow-growing old trees, are recommended."},{"id":"d69af0ed5322ae6c340b42eb69b48ca55fc4190d","doi":"10.1007/978-3-319-92881-4_8","title":"Assessing the Possible Impacts of a 4 °C or Higher Warming in Amazonia","authors":[{"LN":"Sampaio","FN":"G."},{"LN":"Borma","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Cardoso","FN":"M."},{"LN":"Alves","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Randow","FN":"C. von"},{"LN":"Rodriguez","FN":"D."},{"LN":"Nobre","FN":"C."},{"LN":"Alexandre","FN":"Felipe"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Climate Change Risks in Brazil","references":["0147bd75d143009202deb9fa67e6fb66c06aaace","06d2b09b8022b5962a64b5099bf257ca3de8fa3e","07406bc6b42200b6b29628b78c869edec7d55a1e","0ae9d8189f402f4ead91a8ab2a7b930e4588373e","17680fd853f379a1222809fd3b0a914ea034323d","24ea1a28ba226466f9ed10b7ba020808737ade1d","26e4c08520260464ca9ab7d161d062d427055d2a","2857ed828cbeab861d5e9669bc23ca0bae20c848","2dda5d78bc9458b2a2ccd01341becb4bae35cc4b","2f78828a333f2c2ba7f5c793ce26f380d5fc89fa","2fa2b80aa2bfeb777f6e29168952af73176e4201","30515c9df20d1c2c5b270ab944dc6e81b5aa9303","323fcdfbc63cb6a79a0251f1bccad45c5bc3ebb9","32b48d158dccb829ed8e16081cb6d124f22a0793","347bd795ab6024c13cfb2dacd82341b1788840c5","39012bb7ecc4ffc7fadd5bc3de952aaf0d9ec5ce","3f8a865348e1396a12ea3766c4afbe010577ff9b","4d322876371e3d284b9fa663f205c0dcbb98d5c7","4d91bfb4ad8a6bcfd7f7da05d63000a3d7ea4f36","4eb3b8dfbd20430a36b0dc872fd8455d4c16f091","4ffd7867723c4b8de7ca25bd06906e8142c87296","52c528e288e1e229d1e133f1634b960081c1f922","55190c2679453cc46d3e08381913e166a5c08593","59a1d285aa5de669d98844821d2686bf387edb0f","5e4a56cb52ce1e0b86f13a777a462e281a8d8a1d","614f0a07eab4d3240918acda9ca6180b58e89b19","62361cb63ed1c54d09063a13a98d946a1a635e8a","628a3921eaf65e77a6d05a00af961cd68e38bdb7","62db74eafd9824a2228aa4f11f409c533ce1fad4","689e22d358a2fa02c53a273cd28faf7955cae1b5","69ebbd1299ac9b1db121b45dac14b943cdaa2fe7","6a49a87416ec4c317c7d967ae88cc1cd67a6843a","6e604804edaccd7b7e6665f95490dc34ad058cd9","6f2c82d26251cd3294786088780dc7d037e216e7","706a40b0d9e7c046fa206124b78f25117f3e86af","751d8871fbf3c9db426b36b8929a92c3112bc175","7d7544932c13760fecd821fc7ee7061b3b9c3a5f","82ef92ec229fe0a470c29704e79de7bf40ca6202","85859541f542a9526e3b4579683f4090388be102","863c42b6f9ca86a8eba8105a064a7a5b01ec07d6","87b3e77d652ca5d02376cae75bcf567a933efbf1","8a331f5a3e5ee466fd8920ab57f3b08f67cf2843","8c4d03a6bc3f7c1843c47abf0c25e9e5a33836ca","8e031986ce4e98d999dc0db3eb852b93e4eee1ad","8eae17d86e6366f535382447172dfdc2b2c97bc8","9363b046de51950cfea859e1c652fc90aec7af35","962933a6a4587660056787ef898110037181380a","963c95a977e4ce253791a7683ee19d91514a2002","96cae9792fce209ff72dbbdb53b412025afec435","987fc140593dfa3e3990b0702be40f706989eed4","9deb120ec5fac77500a8fa14994452a54fc0cefa","9eda60bf5afd3a5c4d2c1ba644b5dce688e069cc","a0a4cf5ed1c177bae1991e6b07a37d7e64fd055c","a28491ea523c244239626bef166f680b76b51878","a3d8f01949b55309bdf611afd4abb986b70eb78e","a52142f9e3a2bbadc23d950719f4ca428ad82295","a6bc4a16d203b6c7c69fc7420eaf13fa59a8218c","a6dba705b97fa5345374bd275ca5b08498f174f1","ab35a0c0fa3e850079366d8c65cac0636cd22b7f","ac88bf8025a99600ca9bedc9897980bd076976cd","ad5a9f8c5a1872789cb1e20959559de5b5691822","adeb1fbf482c6c9b4b1b2593d7ff733b93869c27","b0cc7cc671c6b4d251d480a3dda2eb3ba79e8db1","b60b54fb0ac90a0f10ca2c54c9a2d2aa2b346367","b9466875b559da0cb52ec34fe364b42c6ea6c3b9","bd819bb6c0d2a8af0030c990d7fe0b707cd558b7","be3eda717b99731f93de80d75031f38e40f84cee","bf8a73fd1ccfcdcac54e79afc6e2c59198fd05cf","bfb40b3517466513e5bd8bcbf879fe26983972d2","c450bcdc8e3fec616ef8c27d307fe09b60cbc57a","c946f820b7e6d4b9ef02668ce82b0ccb52479fd5","ccb5d68fc4aef32b84fcaf409b0b672c46a2bd51","cd208243adede122cc89357261d715fea17f607b","d3d718f3f0e4e6d91b3b13524b3e90496e76f841","de5409f7cab7cf726259448240f392a85ed225d7","e104a75b1bea0e23afdf1f60f7da7a93463dd6e6","e43256238dbfcf1fe37aac918a6d2d033e22d380","e96922f28c1bc26473a64f9b944c6d19b65a434f","ea82dd561febe990385f06863c4afe62f080f187","ecd3e7295f67900ee0281acf39e2a87049085f8d","ee97520406e0b0ca8e69a57af00556fc001d6e4a","ef999c78f85ef4272cfeadb190f1dbd7e640eb2c","f88afc8ffd13b0d8f31f06ff3d8940166d7b0863","fedd542a6c24f5dc2fc3b5cf8391326a605ccf85",null,null,null,null,null,null,null,null],"citations":[],"citationsCount":9,"abstract":"The Amazonian forest’s ability to provide environmental services is threatened by anthropogenic forcing at various scales, such as deforestation, fire, global and regional climate change, and extreme events. In addition to the impacts resulting from each one of these drivers, the synergistic effects potentially increase the risks. In the light of the above, this chapter aims to evaluate the future prospects for the Amazon in a scenario of 4 °C or higher warming resulting from anthropogenic climate change and the related hydrological cycle changes. Future climate scenarios project progressively higher warming that may exceed 4 °C in Amazonia in the second half of the century, particularly during the dry season in the region. Associated with these scenarios, it is projected a reduction of precipitation year-round, being a substantial reduction predominantly in the dry and transition seasons and smaller reductions of the order of 5% for the SH summer. Evaluating the consequences of such substantial climatic change, several negative effects in Amazonia can be anticipated, including short-term hydrological changes similar to the events associated to the extreme 2005 and 2010 droughts, and longer time-scale modifications of broad scale characteristics such as different biome distribution. Based on hydrological models, it is generally expected a reduction in river discharges associated to precipitation decreases and temperature increases brought about by projected climate change, but with the magnitude of the changes differing between models. The future climate change scenarios imply important changes in biomes distribution over Amazonia, with potential expansion of savannah and caatinga over large areas currently occupied by tropical forests. It is necessary a reduction to nearly zero in tropical deforestation and reducing land-cover emissions and mitigating climate change to avoid a dangerous interference with the ability of natural

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientific field. In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientific fields, claimed research findings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research.","isRetracted":false,"isSource":true},"input":[{"id":"W1690786713","doi":"10.1038/NG749","title":"Replication validity of genetic association studies.","authors":[{"LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

Given the number of potentially identifiable genetic markers and the multitude of clinical outcomes to which these may be linked, the testing and validation of statistical hypotheses in genetic epidemiology is a task of unprecedented scale. Meta-analysis provides a quantitative approach for combining the results of various studies on the same topic, and for estimating and explaining their diversity. Here, we have evaluated by meta-analysis 370 studies addressing 36 genetic associations for various outcomes of disease. We show that significant between-study heterogeneity (diversity) is frequent, and that the results of the first study correlate only modestly with subsequent research on the same association. The first study often suggests a stronger genetic effect than is found by subsequent studies. Both bias and genuine population diversity might explain why early association studies tend to overestimate the disease protection or predisposition conferred by a genetic polymorphism. We conclude that a systematic meta-analytic approach may assist in estimating population-wide effects of genetic risk factors in human disease.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2000442546","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(99)04149-5","title":"Improving the quality of reports of meta-analyses of randomised controlled trials: the QUOROM statement","authors":[{"LN":"Moher","FN":"David"},{"LN":"Cook","FN":"Deborah J."},{"LN":"Eastwood","FN":"Susan"},{"LN":"Olkin","FN":"Ingram"},{"LN":"Rennie","FN":"Drummond"},{"LN":"Stroup","FN":"Donna F."}],"year":1999,"journal":"The Lancet","references":["W17094332","W2097110957","W2134338262","W2129829737","W1572929322","W1978868802","W2101299963","W2470285890","W1986215651","W2033238186","W2112339576","W1999564923","W2029045893","W1511524925","W2132645472","W2078782927","W1887056411","W2144504916","W1980300818","W2158767537","W2328451703","W2083923088","W160580327","W2109481947","W2140420026","W2168226052","W2034992074","W2011932878","W2140359845","W2144578562","W1822304021","W2116446898","W1982716565","W2986772077","W62078659","W1974357211","W2037256959","W2067550511","W2092233783","W3216342804","W1662847494","W2056789386","W2057806510","W1492124229","W2093541354"],"citationsCount":4059,"abstract":"Summary Background  The Quality of Reporting of Meta-analyses (QUOROM) conference was convened to address standards for improving the quality of reporting of meta-analyses of clinical randomised controlled trials (RCTs).  Methods  The QUOROM group consisted of 30 clinical epidemiologists, clinicians, statisticians, editors, and researchers. In conference, the group was asked to identify items they thought should be included in a checklist of standards. Whenever possible, checklist items were guided by research evidence suggesting that failure to adhere to the item proposed could lead to biased results. A modified Delphi technique was used in assessing candidate items.  Findings  The conference resulted in the QUOROM statement, a checklist, and a flow diagram. The checklist describes our preferred way to present the abstract, introduction, methods, results, and discussion sections of a report of a meta-analysis. It is organised into 21 headings and subheadings regarding searches, selection, validity assessment, data abstraction, study characteristics, and quantitative data synthesis, and in the results with trial flow, study characteristics, and quantitative data synthesis; research documentation was identified for eight of the 18 items. The flow diagram provides information about both the numbers of RCTs identified, included, and excluded and the reasons for exclusion of trials.  Interpretation  We hope this report will generate further thought about ways to improve the quality of reports of meta-analyses of RCTs and that interested readers, reviewers, researchers, and editors will use the QUOROM statement and generate ideas for its improvement.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1979423827","doi":"10.1001/JAMA.283.15.2008","title":"Meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology - A proposal for reporting","authors":[{"LN":"Stroup","FN":"Donna F."},{"LN":"Berlin","FN":"Jesse A."},{"LN":"Morton","FN":"Sally C."},{"LN":"Olkin","FN":"Ingram"},{"LN":"Williamson","FN":"G.

Deliberations of the workshop were open\nto other interested scientists. Funding for this activity was provided by\nthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.EvidenceWe conducted a systematic review of the published literature on the\nconduct and reporting of meta-analyses in observational studies using MEDLINE,\nEducational Research Information Center (ERIC), PsycLIT, and the Current Index\nto Statistics. We also examined reference lists of the 32 studies retrieved\nand contacted experts in the field. Participants were assigned to small-group\ndiscussions on the subjects of bias, searching and abstracting, heterogeneity,\nstudy categorization, and statistical methods.Consensus ProcessFrom the material presented at the workshop, the authors developed a\nchecklist summarizing recommendations for reporting meta-analyses of observational\nstudies. The checklist and supporting evidence were circulated to all conference\nattendees and additional experts. All suggestions for revisions were addressed.ConclusionsThe proposed checklist contains specifications for reporting of meta-analyses\nof observational studies in epidemiology, including background, search strategy,\nmethods, results, discussion, and conclusion. Use of the checklist should\nimprove the usefulness of meta-analyses for authors, reviewers, editors, readers,\nand decision makers. An evaluation plan is suggested and research areas are\nexplored.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1996647803","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14686-7","title":"Predictive ability of DNA microarrays for cancer outcomes and correlates: an empirical assessment.","authors":[{"LN":"Ntzani","FN":"Evangelia E."},{"LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

We systematically assessed the predictive performance of this method for major clinical outcomes (death, metastasis, recurrence, response to therapy) and the correlation of gene profiling with other clinicopathological correlates of malignant disorders.  Methods  Eligible reports retrieved from MEDLINE (1995 to April, 2003) were assessed for features of study design, reported predictive performance, and consideration of other prognostic factors. We searched for study variables that increased the chances that a significant association with a clinical outcome or correlate would be found.  Findings  84 eligible studies were identified, of which 30 addressed major clinical outcomes. A median of 25 (IQR 15–45) patients with cancer were included. Among the studies of major clinical outcomes, nine did cross-validation but it was complete in only two of them; six studies used independent validation of supervised predictive models. Smaller studies showed better sensitivity and specificity for clinical outcomes than larger studies. Only 11 studies addressing major clinical outcomes did subgroup or adjusted analyses for other prognostic factors. Across all 84 studies, significant associations were 3·5 (95% CI 1·5–8·0) times more likely per doubling of sample size and 9·7 (2·0–47·0) times more likely per ten-fold increase in microarray probes.  Interpretation  DNA microarrays addressing cancer outcomes show variable prognostic performance. Larger studies with appropriate clinical design, adjustment for known predictors, and proper validation are essential for this highly promising technology.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1501619595","doi":"10.1186/1471-2288-1-2","title":"The CONSORT statement: revised recommendations for improving the quality of reports of parallel group randomized trials","authors":[{"LN":"Moher","FN":"David"},{"LN":"Schulz","FN":"Kenneth F."},{"LN":"Altman","FN":"Douglas G."}],"year":2001,"journal":"BMC Medical Research Methodology","references":["W1964333112","W2035374050","W2158504738","W2159452348","W162531492","W2014514659","W2018083763","W2140420026","W2151006952","W2001228357","W2056590595","W2057238067","W2077862869","W1987186637","W1999564923","W2002374666","W2032269598","W2101456614","W2150512505","W1982676263","W1986473748","W2042947293","W2094576856","W2337977161","W79702141","W205418572","W2032012575","W2068959829","W2082942950","W2089463633","W2101422623","W2132372293","W2141487393","W2144504916","W2414455586","W1984992264","W2000442546","W2032525770","W2084639013","W2141324832","W2150663851","W2158767537","W2161478580","W2028297647","W2153517233","W3025704319","W1495252815","W2000034135","W2030958316","W2051556928","W2148853005","W1985408831","W2002891343","W2011932878","W2094302749","W2977262736","W3139845868","W1980278232","W2028892722","W2067550511","W2092365914","W2150798407","W3037603205","W2023630103","W2110554285","W2132428301","W2285388550","W1529153994","W1737868347","W1964853978","W2087170893","W2331442217","W1489582079","W1980403698","W1982890131","W2006546769","W2023133292","W1511524925","W1994959188","W2045127388","W2147581820","W2160193857","W1662847494","W1984052453","W1984115673","W2014727734","W2031256097","W2125297083","W1572929322","W1978868802","W2014871413","W2019398887","W2067316800","W2101299963","W2157222645","W2470285890","W1949694649","W1953850870","W2066238414","W1971348077","W1976529478","W1986215651","W2033238186","W2112339576","W2113264115","W2139879861","W2556045453","W1976095816","W2002089898","W2020158741","W2142960568","W1774486717","W1968114652","W1981890497","W1997236342","W2002409477","W2057806510","W2087213683","W1894101563","W2073286608","W2096101262","W1517800497","W1603966524","W1982716565","W2012958050","W2116470744","W2135444901","W2413361247","W2986772077","W202007523","W1978434965","W2129925362","W2151166219","W2161920747","W1580484836","W1979423827","W2014472662","W2045816935","W2084917404","W2110841701","W1530232666","W2010120422","W2097110957","W2134338262","W2151820683","W1598326110","W2003777351","W2014860965","W2016468831","W2030403882","W2046298145","W2074730588","W2470750097","W1991668508","W2033156884","W2093541354","W2153097236","W2277662797","W2410479776","W1603530131","W2032458802","W2049321668","W2151684674","W1580312531","W1971344361","W1998502362","W2064720974","W2105574076","W2139000771","W2339926369","W1489320201","W2153715117"],"citationsCount":2367,"abstract":"To comprehend the results of a randomized controlled trial (RCT), readers must understand its design, conduct, analysis and interpretation.

The checklist items pertain to the content of the Title, Abstract, Introduction, Methods, Results, and Discussion. The revised checklist includes 22 items selected because empirical evidence indicates that not reporting this information is associated with biased estimates of treatment effect, or because the information is essential to judge the reliability or relevance of the findings. We intended the flow diagram to depict the passage of participants through an RCT. The revised flow diagram depicts information from four stages of a trial (enrolment, intervention allocation, followup, and analysis). The diagram explicitly shows the number of participants, for each intervention group, included in the primary data analysis. Inclusion of these numbers allows the reader to judge whether the authors have done an intentionto- treat analysis.

In this paper we examine what is meant by validation and review why it is necessary. We consider how to validate a model and suggest that it is desirable to consider two rather different aspects - statistical and clinical validity - and examine some general approaches to validation.

This is perhaps particularly the case with respect to epidemiological findings that suggest that some aspect of everyday life is bad for people. Indeed, one recent popular history, the medical journalist James Le Fanu's The Rise and Fall of Modern Medicine , went so far as to suggest that the solution to medicine's ills would be the closure of all departments of epidemiology.1\n\nOne contributory factor is that the medical literature shows a strong tendency to accentuate the positive; positive outcomes are more likely to be reported than null results.2–4 By this means alone a host of purely chance findings will be published, as by conventional reasoning examining 20 associations will produce one result that is “significant at P=0.05” by chance alone. If only positive findings are published then they may be mistakenly considered to be of importance rather than being the necessary chance results produced by the application of criteria for meaningfulness based on statistical significance. As many studies contain long questionnaires collecting information on hundreds of variables, and measure a wide range of potential outcomes, several false positive findings are virtually guaranteed.

The number and characteristics of reported and unreported\ntrial outcomes were recorded from protocols, journal articles, and a survey\nof trialists. An outcome was considered incompletely reported if insufficient\ndata were presented in the published articles for meta-analysis. Odds ratios\nrelating the completeness of outcome reporting to statistical significance\nwere calculated for each trial and then pooled to provide an overall estimate\nof bias. Protocols and published articles were also compared to identify discrepancies\nin primary outcomes.Main Outcome MeasuresCompleteness of reporting of efficacy and harm outcomes and of statistically\nsignificant vs nonsignificant outcomes; consistency between primary outcomes\ndefined in the most recent protocols and those defined in published articles.ResultsOne hundred two trials with 122 published journal articles and 3736\noutcomes were identified. Overall, 50% of efficacy and 65% of harm outcomes\nper trial were incompletely reported. Statistically significant outcomes had\na higher odds of being fully reported compared with nonsignificant outcomes\nfor both efficacy (pooled odds ratio, 2.4; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.4-4.0)\nand harm (pooled odds ratio, 4.7; 95% CI, 1.8-12.0) data. In comparing published\narticles with protocols, 62% of trials had at least 1 primary outcome that\nwas changed, introduced, or omitted. Eighty-six percent of survey responders\n(42/49) denied the existence of unreported outcomes despite clear evidence\nto the contrary.ConclusionsThe reporting of trial outcomes is not only frequently incomplete but\nalso biased and inconsistent with protocols. Published articles, as well as\nreviews that incorporate them, may therefore be unreliable and overestimate\nthe benefits of an intervention. To ensure transparency, planned trials should\nbe registered and protocols should be made publicly available prior to trial\ncompletion.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1575982426","doi":"10.1038/NRC1322","title":"Rules of evidence for cancer molecular-marker discovery and validation","authors":[{"LN":"Ransohoff","FN":"David F."}],"year":2004,"journal":"Nature Reviews Cancer","references":["W1970046651","W1841461389","W1996647803","W2010115073","W2091619551","W1537494447","W2108043112","W2015213611","W2096301110","W2339926369","W154377515","W2061422622","W2107956883","W2161566871","W1607190847","W2012301002","W2051184323","W2111786093","W1985408831","W3211652293","W1996121530","W2091723114","W2128985829","W1561758425","W2161371306","W2037291750","W2080146630","W2313476187","W2418166353","W1985701084","W2043235003","W1599621040","W2151166219","W1976564639","W2168692593","W621403667","W1494628690","W1613856421","W2118203814","W2129303461","W1488258789","W2105862813","W2134389439","W1673663176","W2066135299","W3175417087","W1531730344","W2084898926","W2160450758","W2001485921","W2056577131","W2150027485","W2052525713","W1595581199","W2108725536","W2132145623","W2146112781","W2164337930"],"citationsCount":441,"abstract":"According to some claims, molecular markers are set to revolutionize the process of evaluating prognosis and diagnosis for cancer.

Other researchers have argued that absence of replication may indicate true heterogeneity in gene-disease associations. We suggest that the most important factors underlying inability to replicate these associations are publication bias, failure to attribute results to chance, and inadequate sample sizes, problems that are all rectifiable.

Controversies are most prominent when high-impact research is involved. Objectives To understand how frequently highly cited studies are contradicted or find effects that are stronger than in other similar studies and to discern whether spe- cific characteristics are associated with such refutation over time. Design All original clinical research studies published in 3 major general clinical jour- nals or high-impact-factor specialty journals in 1990-2003 and cited more than 1000 times in the literature were examined. Main Outcome Measure The results of highly cited articles were compared against subsequent studies of comparable or larger sample size and similar or better con- trolled designs. The same analysis was also performed comparatively for matched stud- ies that were not so highly cited. Results Of 49 highly cited original clinical research studies, 45 claimed that the inter- vention was effective. Of these, 7 (16%) were contradicted by subsequent studies, 7 oth- ers (16%) had found effects that were stronger than those of subsequent studies, 20 (44%) were replicated, and 11 (24%) remained largely unchallenged. Five of 6 highly- cited nonrandomized studies had been contradicted or had found stronger effects vs 9 of 39 randomized controlled trials (P=.008). Among randomized trials, studies with con- tradicted or stronger effects were smaller (P=.009) than replicated or unchallenged stud- ies although there was no statistically significant difference in their early or overall cita- tion impact. Matched control studies did not have a significantly different share of refuted results than highly cited studies, but they included more studies with negative results. Conclusions Contradiction and initially stronger effects are not unusual in highly cited research of clinical interventions and their outcomes. The extent to which high citations may provoke contradictions and vice versa needs more study. Controversies are most common with highly cited nonrandomized studies, but even the most highly cited randomized trials may be challenged and refuted over time, especially small ones.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2046875666","doi":"10.1081/BIP-120024202","title":"Comparison of methods for estimating the number of true null hypotheses in multiplicity testing.","authors":[{"LN":"Hsueh","FN":"Huey-Miin"},{"LN":"Chen","FN":"James J."},{"LN":"Kodell","FN":"Ralph L."}],"year":2003,"journal":"Journal of Biopharmaceutical Statistics","references":["W2157795344","W2212673430","W2057758736","W2141407136","W2123830992","W162636959","W1997917263","W1933084501","W2045151287","W2062353821","W2105381419","W14845191","W2172240858","W1986765826","W2110065044","W2143079975","W1982516880","W2057633723"],"citationsCount":90,"abstract":"When a large number of statistical tests is performed, the chance of false positive findings could increase considerably. The traditional approach is to control the probability of rejecting at least one true null hypothesis, the familywise error rate (FWE). To improve the power of detecting treatment differences, an alternative approach is to control the expected proportion of errors among the rejected hypotheses, the false discovery rate (FDR). When some of the hypotheses are not true, the error rate from either the FWE- or the FDR-controlling procedure is usually lower than the designed level. This paper compares five methods used to estimate the number of true null hypotheses over a large number of hypotheses. The estimated number of true null hypotheses is then used to improve the power of FWE- or FDR-controlling methods. Monte Carlo simulations are conducted to evaluate the performance of these methods. The lowest slope method, developed by Benjamini and Hochberg (2000) on the adaptive control of the FDR in multiple testing with independent statistics, and the mean of differences method appear to perform the best.

The debates have been fuelled recently because of seeming total failures, in which the results of observational studies were completely overturned by randomised studies. Hormone replacement therapy showed protection from myocardial infarction in observational studies, but a small increase was seen in randomised trials; a similar reversal happened for carotene and lung cancer. Such discrepancies raise the question: in what circumstances can observational comparisons be as convincing as randomised experiments? To answer that question: I will first recall what is expected from randomisation. I will then describe two specific issues, adverse effects of drugs and genetic causes of disease, to elucidate under what circumstances evidence from observational research is as good as that from randomised trials. This description can be generalised to other areas of clinical and epidemiological research, and leads to a proposal for a three-pronged restriction to give observational research the best chance to be as credible as randomised controlled trials.

Considerable evidence suggests that reporting of harms-related data from RCTs also needs improvement. Members of the CONSORT Group, including journal editors and scientists, met in Montebello, Quebec, Canada, in May 2003 to address this problem. The result is the following document: the standard CONSORT checklist with 10 new recommendations about reporting harms-related issues, accompanying explanation, and examples to highlight specific aspects of proper reporting. We hope that this document, in conjunction with other CONSORT-related materials (http://www.consort-statement.org), will help authors improve their reporting of harms-related data from RCTs.

A major reason for this unfortunate situation is the strategy of declaring statistical significance based on a P value alone, particularly, any P value below.05. The false positive report probability (FPRP), the probability of no true association between a genetic variant and disease given a statistically significant finding, depends not only on the observed P value but also on both the prior probability that the association between the genetic variant and the disease is real and the statistical power of the test. In this commentary, we show how to assess the FPRP and how to use it to decide whether a finding is deserving of attention or noteworthy. We show how this approach can lead to improvements in the design, analysis, and interpretation of molecular epidemiology studies. Our proposal can help investigators, editors, and readers of research articles to protect themselves from overinterpreting statistically significant findings that are not likely to signify a true association. An FPRP-based criterion for deciding whether to call a finding noteworthy formalizes the process already used informally by investigators--that is, tempering enthusiasm for remarkable study findings with considerations of plausibility.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2167098291","doi":"10.1016/S0140-6736(05)17878-7","title":"Microarrays and molecular research: noise discovery?","authors":[{"LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

Knowledge of this gene-expression profile or molecular signature should improve treatment of patients by allowing treatment to be tailored to the severity of the disease. We reanalysed data from the seven largest published studies that have attempted to predict prognosis of cancer patients on the basis of DNA microarray analysis.  Methods  The standard strategy is to identify a molecular signature (ie, the subset of genes most differentially expressed in patients with different outcomes) in a training set of patients and to estimate the proportion of misclassifications with this signature on an independent validation set of patients. We expanded this strategy (based on unique training and validation sets) by using multiple random sets, to study the stability of the molecular signature and the proportion of misclassifications.  Findings  The list of genes identified as predictors of prognosis was highly unstable; molecular signatures strongly depended on the selection of patients in the training sets. For all but one study, the proportion misclassified decreased as the number of patients in the training set increased. Because of inadequate validation, our chosen studies published overoptimistic results compared with those from our own analyses. Five of the seven studies did not classify patients better than chance.  Interpretation  The prognostic value of published microarray results in cancer studies should be considered with caution. We advocate the use of validation by repeated random sampling.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1965992514","doi":"10.1056/NEJMP048286","title":"Failing the public health--rofecoxib, Merck, and the FDA.","authors":[{"LN":"Topol","FN":"Eric J."}],"year":2004,"journal":"The New England Journal of Medicine","references":["W2330496155","W2024233889","W2110809844"],"citationsCount":512,"abstract":"On May 21, 1999, Merck was granted approval by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market rofecoxib (Vioxx).

Furthermore, in the case of other antioxidant vitamins, notably vitamin E, results of single-factor trials and observational studies show a similar discordance to those seen in our figure for vitamin C. 2-4 Why did observational studies and randomised controlled trials come up with different answers? Several reasons have been proposed for the disparity between the results of observational epidemiological studies and trials. First, antioxidants might be useful only for primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, and not protective once atherosclerosis is established. 6 However, trials 4,7 found that antioxidants did not reduce cardio- vascular disease risk in participants who had no evidence of this disorder at randomisation. Second, in many of the trials the choice of antioxidant regimen has been criticised. 6","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2062248680","doi":"10.1136/BMJ.322.7291.879","title":"Any casualties in the clash of randomised and observational evidence","authors":[{"LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

We hypothesized that controversial data are attractive to investigators and editors, and thus the most extreme, opposite results would appear very early rather than late, as data accumulate, provided data can be generated rapidly.    Methods  We used data from MEDLINE-indexed meta-analyses of case–control studies on genetic associations (retrospective, hypothesis-generating research with usually rapid turnaround) and meta-analyses of randomized trials of health care interventions (prospective, targeted research that usually takes longer) sampled from the Cochrane Library. Using cumulative meta-analysis, we evaluated how the between-study variance for studies on the same question changed over time and at what point the studies with the most extreme results ever observed had been published.    Results  The maximal between-study variance was more likely to be recorded early in the 44 eligible meta-analyses of genetic associations than in the 37 meta-analyses of health care interventions ( P  = .013). At the time of the first heterogeneity assessment, the most favorable-ever result in support of a specific association was more likely to appear than the least favorable-ever result (22 vs. 10,  P  = .017); the opposite was seen at the second heterogeneity assessment (15 vs. 5,  P  = .031). Such a sequence of extreme opposite results was not seen in the clinical trials meta-analyses. The estimated between-study variance decreased over time in genetic association studies ( P  = .010), but not in clinical trials ( P  = .30).    Conclusion  In contrast to prospective trials, a rapid early sequence of extreme, opposite results is frequent in retrospective hypothesis-generating molecular research.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1988934365","doi":"10.1080/135952201753172953","title":"Two cheers for P-values?","authors":[{"LN":"Senn","FN":"S"}],"year":2001,"journal":"Journal of Epidemiology and Biostatistics","references":["W1515242458","W2031775018","W2148279862","W2128585330","W2136634361","W1988804493","W1498066347","W2074466695","W2089984663","W2063068713","W2029868690","W2797043160","W43363623","W2009512591","W2045638068","W1984486655","W2050283732","W2060512257","W2040809707","W1533179050","W2795767164","W3021826975","W2088979439","W313369389"],"citationsCount":60,"abstract":"P-values are a practical success but a critical failure.

In this framework, a research finding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a field are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater flexibility in designs, definitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater financial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientific field in chase of statistical significance.

As of May, 1990, 285 of the studies had been analysed by the investigators, and 52% of these had been published. Studies with statistically significant results were more likely to be published than those finding no difference between the study groups (adjusted odds ratio [OR] 2.32; 95% confidence interval [Cl] 1.25-4.28). Studies with significant results were also more likely to lead to a greater number of publications and presentations and to be published in journals with a high citation impact factor. An increased likelihood of publication was also associated with a high rating by the investigator of the importance of the study results, and with increasing sample size. The tendency towards publication bias was greater with observational and laboratory-based experimental studies (OR = 3.79; 95% Cl = 1.47-9.76) than with randomised clinical trials (OR = 0.84; 95% Cl = 0.34-2.09).

Recent methodologic analyses indicate that inadequate reporting and design are associated with biased estimates of treatment effects. Such systematic error is seriously damaging to RCTs, which boast the elimination of systematic error as their primary hallmark. Systematic error in RCTs reflects poor science, and poor science threatens proper ethical standards. A group of scientists and editors developed the CONSORT (Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials) statement to improve the quality of reporting of RCTs. The statement consists of a checklist and flow diagram that authors can use for reporting an RCT. Many leading medical journals and major international editorial groups have adopted the CONSORT statement. The CONSORT statement facilitates critical appraisal and interpretation of RCTs by providing guidance to authors about how to improve the reporting of their trials. This explanatory and elaboration document is intended to enhance the use, understanding, and dissemination of the CONSORT statement. The meaning and rationale for each checklist item are presented. For most items, at least one published example of good reporting and, where possible, references to relevant empirical studies are provided. Several examples of flow diagrams are included.

Yet there is increasing evidence that trial quality can affect estimates of intervention efficacy. We investigated whether different methods of quality assessment provide different estimates of intervention efficacy evaluated in randomised controlled trials (RCTs).  Methods  We randomly selected 11 meta-analyses that involved 127 RCTs on the efficacy of interventions used for circulatory and digestive diseases, mental health, and pregnancy and childbirth. We replicated all the meta-analyses using published data from the primary studies. The quality of reporting of all 127 clinical trials was assessed by means of component and scale approaches. To explore the effects of quality on the quantitative results, we examined the effects of different methods of incorporating quality scores (sensitivity analysis and quality weights) on the results of the meta-analyses.  Findings  The quality of trials was low. Masked assessments provided significantly higher scores than unmasked assessments (mean 2·74 [SD 1·10]  vs  2·55 [1·20]). Low-quality trials (score ·2), compared with high-quality trials (score >2), were associated with an increased estimate of benefit of 34% (ratio of odds ratios [ROR] 0·66 [95% CI 0·52–0·83]). Trials that used inadequate allocation concealment, compared with those that used adequate methods, were also associated with an increased estimate of benefit (37%; ROR=0·63 [0·45–0·88]). The average treatment benefit was 39% (odds ratio [OR] 0·61 [0·57–0·65]) for all trials, 52% (OR 0·48 [0·43–0·54]) for low-quality trials, and 29% (OR 0·71 [0·65–0·77]) for high-quality trials. Use of all the trial scores as quality weights reduced the effects to 35% (OR 0·65 [0·59–0·71]) and resulted in the least statistical heterogeneity.  Interpretation  Studies of low methodological quality in which the estimate of quality is incorporated into the meta-analyses can alter the interpretation of the benefit of intervention, whether a scale or component approach is used in the assessment of trial quality.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1963936426","doi":"10.1073/PNAS.95.19.11389","title":"Tests and estimates of allelic association in complex inheritance.","authors":[{"LN":"Morton","FN":"Newton E."},{"LN":"Collins","FN":"Andrew"}],"year":1998,"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","references":["W2105322480","W1978339005","W1997887791","W2135577623","W2013869066","W2095051032","W1999196790","W2006028276","W2026444780","W2035064373","W2028337763","W2087418803","W2051008597","W1543868019","W2009860181","W1999843368","W1560012080","W2014271461"],"citationsCount":235,"abstract":"Family-based procedures such as the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) were motivated by concern that sample-based methods to map disease genes by allelic association are not robust to population stratification, migration, and admixture. Other factors to consider in designing a study of allelic association are specification of gene action in a weakly parametric model, efficiency, diagnostic reliability for hypernormal individuals, interest in linkage and imprinting, and sibship composition. Family-based samples lend themselves to the TDT despite its inefficiency compared with cases and unrelated normal controls. The TDT has an efficiency of 1/2 for parent-offspring pairs and 2/3 for father-mother-child trios. Against cases and hypernormal controls, the efficiency is only 1/6 on the null hypothesis. Although dependent on marker gene frequency and other factors, efficiency for hypernormal controls is always greater than for random controls. Efficiency of the TDT is increased in multiplex families and by inclusion of normal sibs, approaching a case-control design with normal but not hypernormal controls. Isolated cases favor unrelated controls, and only in exceptional populations would avoidance of stratification justify a family-based design to map disease genes by allelic association.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2024119733","doi":"10.1001/JAMA.279.14.1089","title":"Issues in Comparisons Between Meta-analyses and Large Trials","authors":[{"LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

Epidemiologic evidence indicates that diets high in carotenoid-rich fruits and vegetables, as well as high serum levels of vitamin E (alpha-tocopherol) and beta carotene, are associated with a reduced risk of lung cancer. Methods. We performed a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled primary-prevention trial to determine whether daily supplementation with alpha-tocopherol, beta carotene, or both would reduce the incidence of lung cancer and other cancers. A total of 29,133 male smokers 50 to 69 years of age from southwestern Finland were randomly assigned to one of four regimens: alpha-tocopherol (50 mg per day) alone, beta carotene (20 mg per day) alone, both alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene, or placebo. Follow-up continued for five to eight years. Results. Among the 876 new cases of lung cancer diagnosed during the trial, no reduction in incidence was observed among the men who received alpha-tocopherol (change in incidence as compared with those who did not, -2 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, -14 to 12 percent). Unexpectedly, we observed a higher incidence of lung cancer among the men who received beta carotene than among those who did not (change in incidence, 18 percent; 95 percent confidence interval, 3 to 36 percent). We found no evidence of an interaction between alpha-tocopherol and beta carotene with respect to the incidence of lung cancer. Fewer cases of prostate cancer were diagnosed among those who received alpha-tocopherol than among those who did not. Beta carotene had little or no effect on the incidence of cancer other than lung cancer. Alpha-tocopherol had no apparent effect on total mortality, although more deaths from hemorrhagic stroke were observed among the men who received this supplement than among those who did not. Total mortality was 8 percent higher (95 percent confidence interval, 1 to 16 percent) among the participants who received beta carotene than among those who did not","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W1970046651","doi":"10.1056/NEJM197809282991304","title":"The importance of beta, the type II error and sample size in the design and interpretation of the randomized control trial.

Performing a new meta-analysis whenever the results of a new trial of a particular therapy are published permits the study of trends in efficacy and makes it possible to determine when a new treatment appears to be significantly effective or deleterious. We describe the use of such a procedure, cumulative meta-analysis, to assess therapeutic trials among patients with myocardial infarction. Methods. We performed cumulative meta-analyses of clinical trials that evaluated 15 treatments and preventive measures for acute myocardial infarction. Results. An example of this method is its application to the use of intravenous streptokinase as thrombolytic therapy for acute infarction. Thirty-three trials evaluating this therapy were performed between 1959 and 1988.

The major factor hypothesized to be associated with publication was results, which included both statistically significant results and results assessed by the investigators to be qualitatively significant, when statistical testing was  done. Other factors hypothesized to have a possible association with publication were funding institute, funding mechanism (grant versus contract versus intramural), multicenter status, use of comparison groups, large sample size, type of control (parallel versus nonparallel), use of randomization and masking, type of analysis (by treatment received versus by treatment assigned), and investigator sex and rank. DESIGN Follow-up, by 1988 interview with the principal investigator or surrogate, of all clinical trials funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) in 1979, to learn of trial results and publication status. POPULATION Two hundred ninety-three NIH trials, funded in 1979. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE Publication of clinical trial results. RESULTS Of the 198 clinical trials completed by 1988, 93% had been published. Trials with  results were more likely to be published than those showing nonsignificant results (adjusted odds ratio [OR] = 12.30; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.54 to 60.00). No other factor was positively associated with publication. Most unpublished trials remained so because investigators thought the results were not interesting or they did  have enough time (42.8%). Metaanalysis using data from this and 3 similar studies provided a combined unadjusted OR of 2.88 (95% CI, 2.13 to 3.89) for the association between significant results and publication. CONCLUSIONS Even when the overall publication rate is high, such as for trials funded by the NIH, publication bias remains a significant problem. Given the importance of trials and their utility in evaluating medical treatments, especially within the context of metaanalysis, it is clear that we need more reliable systems for maintaining information about initiated studies. Trial registers represent such a system but must receive increased financial support to succeed.","isRetracted":false},{"id":"W2000034135","doi":"10.1001/JAMA.285.4.437","title":"Completeness of Safety Reporting in Randomized Trials: An Evaluation of 7 Medical Areas","authors":[{"LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

The “replication crisis” has been attributed to misguided external incentives gamed by researchers (the strategic-game hypothesis). Here, I want to draw attention to a complementary internal factor, namely, researchers’ widespread faith in a statistical ritual and associated delusions (the statistical-ritual hypothesis). The “null ritual,” unknown in statistics proper, eliminates judgment precisely at points where statistical theories demand it. The crucial delusion is that the p value specifies the probability of a successful replication (i.e., 1 – p), which makes replication studies appear to be superfluous. A review of studies with 839 academic psychologists and 991 students shows that the replication delusion existed among 20% of the faculty teaching statistics in psychology, 39% of the professors and lecturers, and 66% of the students. Two further beliefs, the illusion of certainty (e.g., that statistical significance proves that an effect exists) and Bayesian wishful thinking (e.g., that the probability of the alternative hypothesis being true is 1 – p), also make successful replication appear to be certain or almost certain, respectively. In every study reviewed, the majority of researchers (56%–97%) exhibited one or more of these delusions. Psychology departments need to begin teaching statistical thinking, not rituals, and journal editors should no longer accept manuscripts that report results as “significant” or “not significant.” </jats:p>"},{"id":"10.1007/978-1-4757-1923-9","numberInSourceReferences":5,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4757-1923-9","title":"Testing Statistical Hypotheses","authors":[{"LN":"Lehmann","FN":"E.

We review why degrading<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-values into ‘significant’ and ‘nonsignificant’ contributes to making studies irreproducible, or to making them seem irreproducible. A major problem is that we tend to take small<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-values at face value, but mistrust results with larger<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-values. In either case,<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-values tell little about reliability of research, because they are hardly replicable even if an alternative hypothesis is true. Also significance (<jats:italic>p</jats:italic> ≤ 0.05) is hardly replicable: at a good statistical power of 80%, two studies will be ‘conflicting’, meaning that one is significant and the other is not, in one third of the cases if there is a true effect. A replication can therefore not be interpreted as having failed only because it is nonsignificant. Many apparent replication failures may thus reflect faulty judgment based on significance thresholds rather than a crisis of unreplicable research. Reliable conclusions on replicability and practical importance of a finding can only be drawn using cumulative evidence from multiple independent studies. However, applying significance thresholds makes cumulative knowledge unreliable. One reason is that with anything but ideal statistical power, significant effect sizes will be biased upwards. Interpreting inflated significant results while ignoring nonsignificant results will thus lead to wrong conclusions. But current incentives to hunt for significance lead to selective reporting and to publication bias against nonsignificant findings. Data dredging,<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-hacking, and publication bias should be addressed by removing fixed significance thresholds. Consistent with the recommendations of the late Ronald Fisher,<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-values should be interpreted as graded measures of the strength of evidence against the null hypothesis. Also larger<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-values offer some evidence against the null hypothesis, and they cannot be interpreted as supporting the null hypothesis, falsely concluding that ‘there is no effect’. Information on possible true effect sizes that are compatible with the data must be obtained from the point estimate, e.g., from a sample average, and from the interval estimate, such as a confidence interval. We review how confusion about interpretation of larger<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-values can be traced back to historical disputes among the founders of modern statistics. We further discuss potential arguments against removing significance thresholds, for example that decision rules should rather be more stringent, that sample sizes could decrease, or that<jats:italic>p</jats:italic>-values should better be completely abandoned. We conclude that whatever method of statistical inference we use, dichotomous threshold thinking must give way to non-automated informed judgment.</jats:p>"},{"id":"10.5735/086.046.0501","doi":"10.5735/086.046.0501","title":"Final Collapse of the Neyman-Pearson Decision Theoretic Framework and Rise of the neoFisherian","authors":[{"LN":"Hurlbert","FN":"Stuart H."},{"LN":"Lombardi","FN":"Celia M."}],"year":2009,"journal":"Annales Zoologici Fennici","references":[],"citationsCount":159},{"id":"10.1177/0956797613504966","doi":"10.1177/0956797613504966","title":"The New Statistics","authors":[{"LN":"Cumming","FN":"Geoff","affil":"[object Object]"}],"year":2013,"journal":"Psychological Science","references":[null,null,"10.1007/978-0-230-36355-7","10.1207/S15327752JPA6703_13","10.1037/1082-989X.10.4.397","10.1037/A0016619","10.1002/9780470743386","10.1037/H0045186",null,"10.1037/A0015565",null,null,"10.1111/J.1467-9639.2007.00267.X","10.1111/J.1745-6924.2008.00079.X","10.1002/SIM.3471",null,"10.1027/0044-3409.217.1.15","10.1111/J.1742-9536.2011.00037.X","10.1083/JCB.200611141","10.1177/0013164401614002","10.1037/0003-066X.60.2.170","10.1037/1082-989X.11.3.217","10.1207/S15328031US0304_5",null,"10.1093/ACPROF:OSO/9780195308969.003.0009","10.1017/CBO9780511761676","10.1037/0003-066X.63.7.591","10.1016/J.BRAT.2007.12.001",null,null,"10.1027/0044-3409.217.1.27","10.1111/J.0963-7214.2004.01502008.X","10.1177/1745691612462587","10.1093/JPEPSY/JSN118","10.3758/BF03195577","10.1037/A0024338","10.1093/OXFORDJOURNALS.AJE.A114229","10.4324/9780203803233","10.1198/000313001300339897","10.7326/0003-4819-108-2-258","10.3758/BF03192993","10.3758/S13428-013-0330-5","10.1002/9780470756973.CH5","10.1037/10693-000","10.1037/14136-000",null,"10.1080/17470218.2012.711335","10.1037/H0087426","10.1037/1082-989X.9.2.147","10.1146/ANNUREV.PSYCH.59.103006.093735","10.1017/CBO9780511802454","10.4324/9780203840023","10.1177/1745691612465253","10.1037/A0018326",null,null,"10.1348/000711007X255327","10.1177/0956797611417632","10.4135/9781412983761","10.1177/1745691612465075","10.1037/1082-989X.9.2.164",null,null,null,"10.1111/J.1464-0597.2008.00348.X","10.1177/1745691612463078","10.1201/9781466503236","10.1037/0003-066X.54.8.594"],"citationsCount":1576,"abstract":"<jats:p> We need to make substantial changes to how we conduct research. First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline. </jats:p>"},{"id":"10.1080/01621459.2017.1289846","doi":"10.1080/01621459.2017.1289846","title":"Statistical Significance and the Dichotomization of
