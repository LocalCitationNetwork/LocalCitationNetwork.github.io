We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using high-powered designs and original materials when available.

Thirty-six percent of replications had statistically significant results; 47% of original effect sizes were in the 95% confidence interval of the replication effect size; 39% of effects were subjectively rated to have replicated the original result; and if no bias in original results is assumed, combining original and replication results left 68% with statistically significant effects.

First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem.

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientifi c fi eld. In this framework, a research fi nding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a fi eld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater fl exibility in designs, defi nitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater fi nancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientifi c fi eld in chase of statistical signifi cance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true. Moreover, for many current scientifi c fi elds, claimed research fi ndings may often be simply accurate measures of the prevailing bias. In this essay, I discuss the implications of these problems for the conduct and interpretation of research. It can be proven that most claimed research fi ndings are false."},{"id":1575893985,"microsoftAcademicId":1575893985,"doi":"10.1177/1745691612462588","title":"An Open, Large-Scale, Collaborative Effort to Estimate the Reproducibility of Psychological Science","authors":[{"LN":"Lakens","FN":"D Daniël","affil":"Eindhoven Univ Technol"}],"year":2012,"journal":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","references":[2144981148,1987777080,2161498332,2067833766,2100267603,2139598698,2753533763,2021458971,2019866696,2148613765,1985740357,2123353886,2141058981,2023964994,2116618538,1980315095,2592090507,1605573559,2062457019,1565693361,2330437380,2330671894],"citationsCount":368,"abstract":"Reproducibility is a defining feature of science.

Publishing norms emphasize novel, positive results. As such, disciplinary incentives encourage design, analysis, and reporting decisions that elicit positive results and ignore negative results. Prior reports demonstrate how these incentives inflate the rate of false effects in published science. When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive—getting it right—competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive—getting it published. This article develops strategies for improving scientific practices and knowledge accumulation that account for ordinary human motivations and biases."},{"id":2021458971,"microsoftAcademicId":2021458971,"doi":"10.1037/a0015108","title":"Shall we really do it again?

This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the “hardness” of scientific research—i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors—is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a “positive” (full or partial) or “negative” support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in “softer” sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree."},{"id":2128246772,"microsoftAcademicId":2128246772,"doi":"10.1016/j.tics.2014.02.010","title":"Publication and other reporting biases in cognitive sciences: detection, prevalence, and prevention","authors":[{"LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.A.","affil":"Department of Medicine, Stanford University School of Medicine, Stanford, CA 94305, USA"},{"LN":"Munafò","FN":"Marcus R.","affil":"University of Bristol"},{"LN":"Fusar-Poli","FN":"Paolo","affil":"King's College London"},{"LN":"Nosek","FN":"Brian A.","affil":"Center for Open Science"},{"LN":"David","FN":"Sean P.","affil":"Stanford University"}],"year":2014,"journal":"Trends in Cognitive Sciences","references":[1987777080,2161498332,2105824687,2564042923,2116153150,2067833766,2091959199,2119605658,2033585778,2100267603,1690786713,2046391772,2065267852,2139598698,1981033874,2039418122,2134852288,2150215887,2080209500,1941783251,2002062153,2149893809,2164759539,2025471227,2097310500,2123263696,2053239079,2002030061,2021458971,2096656075,2103718021,1575893985,2144659346,1987673761,2005295476,1968886567,2006546769,2101872155,2073677120,2101083347,2143083982,2156110385,2117981173,2140382548,2168672683,2165828377,2013399300,2169662981,2093855897,2112039868,2040331591,2110476643,2098907700,2153627933,2086252264,2165176433,2127787997,2076224203,1991142512,2062631953,2001871336,2109462702,1975996475,2022160389,1993480036,2026056573,2056916538,1543699334,2109162089,2139542843,2037455308,1996865470,2476907122,2069224123,2116618538,2168599342,2080937370,2145118513,2028171536,2115494678,2065037887,2164524694,2145499755,2142922919,2315521453,1601856453,1831901831,1517830075,2980944224,2062908954],"citationsCount":268,"abstract":"Recent systematic reviews and empirical evaluations of the cognitive sciences literature suggest that publication and other reporting biases are prevalent across diverse domains of cognitive science.

First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data- analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline."},{"id":1993266153,"microsoftAcademicId":1993266153,"doi":"10.1177/1745691612465253","title":"Editors' Introduction to the Special Section on Replicability in Psychological Science: A Crisis of Confidence?","authors":[{"LN":"Pashler","FN":"Harold","affil":"University of California, San Diego"},{"LN":"Wagenmakers","FN":"Eric–Jan","affil":"University of Amsterdam"}],"year":2012,"journal":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","references":[2144981148,1987777080,2161498332,2067833766,2100267603,2118699776,2169244873,1575893985,2072620887,2015265189,2167083402,1987673761,2169214811,2006546769,2112039868,2155439155,2092515573,2142075785,2125515636,1979863478,2065390467,2140016124,2152080836],"citationsCount":960},{"id":2151509224,"microsoftAcademicId":2151509224,"doi":"10.1177/0956797614567341","title":"Small Telescopes Detectability and the Evaluation of Replication Results","authors":[{"LN":"Simonsohn","FN":"Uri","affil":"University of Pennsylvania"}],"year":2015,"journal":"Psychological Science","references":[2037124948,2105824687,2107031757,2127875809,2033198212,1999649023,1978662219,2030360178,1981033874,2150215887,2064604759,2126539575,2055721458,2066255970,2145199837,1575893985,2155449866,2073157712,2011550426,2098526516,2076763018,1903417059,1985740357,2106752002,2155930071,1549228047,1985876211,2076438548,2883848285,1824379121,2143195287,2116618538,2017851494,2183510664,2169034499,2086337008,2151176360,1537452430,2012120824,2021788326,114098103,2594756650,2101170002,1565693361,2037470347,2962878953,2002735054,2087163955,12016890,2900474634],"citationsCount":371,"citationContext":{"1537452430":["For example, in Figure 2 we see that while Feddersen et al.

To increase the reliability and accuracy of published papers, multiple changes have been proposed, such as changes in statistical methods. We support such reforms. However, we believe that the incentive structure of scientific publishing must change for such reforms to be successful. Under the current system, the quality of individual scientists is judged on the basis of their number of publications and citations, with journals similarly judged via numbers of citations. Neither of these measures takes into account the replicability of the published findings, as false or controversial results are often particularly widely cited. We propose tracking replications as a means of post-publication evaluation, both to help researchers identify reliable findings and to incentivize the publication of reliable results. Tracking replications requires a database linking published studies that replicate one another. As any such database is limited by the number of replication attempts published, we propose establishing an open-access journal dedicated to publishing replication attempts. Data quality of both the database and the affiliated journal would be ensured through a combination of crowd-sourcing and peer review. As reports in the database are aggregated, ultimately it will be possible to calculate replicability scores, which may be used alongside citation counts to evaluate the quality of work published in individual journals. In this paper, we lay out a detailed description of how this system could be implemented, including mechanisms for compiling the information, ensuring data quality, and incentivizing the research community to participate."},{"id":2139168999,"microsoftAcademicId":2139168999,"doi":"10.18637/jss.v036.i03","title":"Conducting Meta-Analyses in R with the metafor Package","authors":[{"LN":"Viechtbauer","FN":"Wolfgang"}],"year":2010,"journal":"Journal of Statistical Software","references":[2126930838,2157823046,2107328434,612372977,1964435302,2033585778,1999649023,1590137713,2036740,1966953116,2071589850,2039418122,2134852288,2128076015,2126602143,1982585616,2568362704,1528251861,2079213131,2043565183,1988143463,1964605289,2075477269,2157347940,2044414901,1511920456,1521222329,2145147745,2157291679,2116446898,1982070737,1983607152,2103026252,2036756589,2038886783,2150000105,1970128129,2970863555,2154449833,2077165978,2157508850,2006979162,2980978202,2257179205,2155053630,1995662581,1593093988,171580799,1581410893,1984535767,1994959188,2056366475,2111636520,2116951140,2170409302,2954444828,2139066039,2156328692,573221398,142774744,2060909815,1878003051,1966553019,2027844856,1996843362,1970555566,2116794909,2330813625,2043466393,1985990462,2172642265,2011525295,2074963254,2118928783,2075588483,1974084046,2049380243,150372367,2092923243,404240460],"citationsCount":4947,"citationContext":{"2036740":["In particular, if studies with small and/or non-significant findings remain unpublished (and therefore are less likely to be included in a meta-analysis), then this may result in an asymmetric funnel plot (Light and Pillemer 1984;

Most articles on effect sizes highlight their importance to communicate the practical significance of results. For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA’s such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results.

Combined with the low power of most current work, this often leads to the use of misleading criteria about whether an effect has replicated. Rosenthal (1990) suggested more appropriate criteria, here labeled the continuously cumulating metaanalytic (CCMA) approach. For example, a CCMA analysis on a replication attempt that does not reach significance might nonetheless provide more, not less, evidence that the effect is real. Alternatively, measures of heterogeneity might show that two studies that differ in whether they are significant might have only trivially different effect sizes. We present a nontechnical introduction to the CCMA framework (referencing relevant software), and then explain how it can be used to address aspects of replicability or more generally to assess quantitative evidence from numerous studies. We then present some examples and simulation results using the CCMA approach that show how the combination of evidence can yield improved results over the consideration of single studies."},{"id":2292132415,"microsoftAcademicId":2292132415,"doi":"10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01151.x","title":"What Kind of Empirical Research Should We Publish, Fund, and Reward?: A Different Perspective","authors":[{"LN":"Rozin","FN":"Paul"}],"year":2009,"journal":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","references":[2158810025,2102770351,2030988365,2741340870,1725435973,2166232365,2100213394,2061131717,2101194318,2126466006,2019406391,1975762581,2019692889,2074481508],"citationsCount":105,"citationContext":{"1725435973":["To me, one of the most valuable and elegant contributions of thelast2decadesinsocialpsychologyistheworkontheculture of honor by  Nisbett and Cohen (1996) .\u001bThe rest of the impressive initial work on culture of honor ( Nisbett & Cohen, 1996 ) brought to bear the many sophistications and the ingenuity often exhibited, and beautifully developed, in experimental social psychological research.\u001b( Nisbett & Cohen, 1996,  offer a cultural-evolutionary account for the culture of honor in their book, but the work stands on its own as description of phenomena whether or not one subscribes to their theory.)

This new edition of Kuhn's essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introductory essay by Ian Hacking that clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn's ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking's essay provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science."},{"id":2123263696,"microsoftAcademicId":2123263696,"doi":"10.1177/1745691612463078","title":"An Agenda for Purely Confirmatory Research","authors":[{"LN":"Wagenmakers","FN":"Eric-Jan","affil":"University of Amsterdam"},{"LN":"Wetzels","FN":"Ruud","affil":"University of Amsterdam"},{"LN":"Borsboom","FN":"Denny","affil":"University of Amsterdam"},{"LN":"Maas","FN":"Han L.

In this article, we discuss an uncomfortable fact that threatens the core of psychology’s academic enterprise: almost without exception, psychologists do not commit themselves to a method of data analysis before they see the actual data. It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired result—a procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label “confirmatory,” and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled “exploratory.” We illustrate our proposal with a confirmatory replication attempt of a study on extrasensory perception."},{"id":1987673761,"microsoftAcademicId":1987673761,"doi":"10.1177/1745691612460688","title":"Replications in psychology research: How often do they really occur?","authors":[{"LN":"Makel","FN":"Matthew C.","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Plucker","FN":"Jonathan A.","affil":"University of Connecticut"},{"LN":"Hegarty","FN":"Boyd","affil":"University of New Hampshire"}],"year":2012,"journal":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","references":[2144981148,2037124948,2118699776,2080209500,2169244873,2018443796,2021458971,2094419105,2019866696,2032866148,2165719008,1979863478,2042930386,2596562148,2002955157,2018318609,2167037159,2165944832,2945393134,1977602123,2035742891,2067566126,2127216477,2083435216,2412035472],"citationsCount":507,"citationContext":{"2094419105":["Just as Campbell and Stanley (1963) cautioned against considering experimental methods as a panacea, all replications are not of equal value."],"2165944832":["Lykken (1968) noted that, as researchers, “we are interested in the construct ."],"2167037159":["Currently, the system used to determine what studies merit replication is, as Hunt (1975) somewhat generously described, “informal and somewhat haphazard and could be improved” (p."],"2412035472":["The first use of the term replication that we found in a psychology journal was Rosenblith’s article (1949) in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, titled “A Replication of Some Roots of Prejudice,” which successfully replicated the findings of Allport and Kramer (1946) while relying on college students in South Dakota instead of those in Harvard, Radcliffe, and Dartmouth."],"2596562148":["The first use of the term replication that we found in a psychology journal was Rosenblith’s article (1949) in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, titled “A Replication of Some Roots of Prejudice,” which successfully replicated the findings of Allport and Kramer (1946) while relying on college students in South Dakota instead of those in Harvard, Radcliffe, and Dartmouth.","The recent publication of a controversial study on extrasensory perception (Bem, 2011) along with a few well-publicized fraud cases have catalyzed a healthy conversation within the psychological research community about the process used to publish research (e.g., Carpenter, 2012; Crocker & Cooper, 2011; Roediger, 2012; Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, & van der Mass, 2011; but cf.

In this paper, we argue that prevention science will be better positioned to help improve public health if (a) more replications are conducted; (b) those replications are systematic, thoughtful, and conducted with full knowledge of the trials that have preceded them; and (c) state-of-the art techniques are used to summarize the body of evidence on the effects of the interventions. Under real-world demands it is often not feasible to wait for multiple replications to accumulate before making decisions about intervention adoption. To help individuals and agencies make better decisions about intervention utility, we outline strategies that can be used to help understand the likely direction, size, and range of intervention effects as suggested by the current knowledge base. We also suggest structural changes that could increase the amount and quality of replication research, such as the provision of incentives and a more vigorous pursuit of prospective research registers. Finally, we discuss methods for integrating replications into the roll-out of a program and suggest that strong partnerships with local decision makers are a key component of success in replication research. Our hope is that this paper can highlight the importance of replication and stimulate more discussion of the important elements of the replication process.

To the mathematician, it is an intricate formal calculus, to be explored and developed with little professional concern for any empirical significance that might attach to the terms and propositions involved. To the philosopher, it is an embarrassing mystery whose justification and conceptual clarification have remained stubbornly refractory to philosophical insight. (A famous philosophical epigram has it that induction [a special case of statistical inference] is the glory of science and the scandal of philosophy.) To the experimental scientist, however, statistical inference is a research instrument, a processing device by which unwieldy masses of raw data may be refined into a product more suitable for assimilation into the corpus of science, and in this lies both strength and weakness. It is strength in that, as an ultimate consumer of statistical methods, the experimentalist is in position to demand that the techniques made available to him conform to his actual needs. But it is also weakness in that, in his need for the tools constructed by a highly technical formal discipline, the experimentalist, who has specialized along other lines, seldom feels competent to extend criticisms or even comments; he is much more likely to make unquestioning application of procedures learned more or less by rote from persons assumed to be more knowledgeable of statistics than he.

Building upon the corresponding literature, we provide here a nontechnical overview of well-established methods used to analyze OMICS data within three main types of regression-based approaches: univariate models including multiple testing correction strategies, dimension reduction techniques, and variable selection models. Our methodological description focuses on methods for which ready-to-use implementations are available. We describe the main underlying assumptions, the main features, and advantages and limitations of each of the models. This descriptive summary constitutes a useful tool for driving methodological choices while analyzing OMICS data, especially in environmental epidemiology, where the emergence of the exposome concept clearly calls for unified methods to analyze marginally and jointly complex exposure and OMICS datasets.

We describe a method that enables explicit detection and correction of population stratification on a genome-wide scale. Our method uses principal components analysis to explicitly model ancestry differences between cases and controls. The resulting correction is specific to a candidate marker’s variation in frequency across ancestral populations, minimizing spurious associations while maximizing power to detect true associations. Our simple, efficient approach can easily be applied to disease studies with hundreds of thousands of markers. Population stratification—allele frequency differences between cases and controls due to systematic ancestry differences—can cause spurious associations in disease studies 1‐8 . Because the effects of stratification vary in proportion to the number of samples 9 , stratification will be an increasing problem in the large-scale association studies of the future, which will analyze thousands of samples in an effort to detect common genetic variants of weak effect. The two prevailing methods for dealing with stratification are genomic control and structured association 9‐14 . Although genomic control and structured association have proven useful in a variety of contexts, they have limitations. Genomic control corrects for stratification by adjusting association statistics at each marker by a uniform overall inflation factor. However, some markers differ in their allele frequencies across ancestral populations more than others. Thus, the uniform adjustment applied by genomic control may be insufficient at markers having unusually strong differentiation across ancestral populations and may be superfluous at markers devoid of such differentiation, leading to a loss in power. Structured association uses a program such as STRUCTURE 15 to assign the samples to discrete subpopulation clusters and then aggregates evidence of association within each cluster. If fractional membership in more than one cluster is allowed, the method cannot currently be applied to genome-wide association studies because of its intensive computational cost on large data sets. Furthermore, assignments of individuals to clusters are highly sensitive to the number of clusters, which is not well defined 14,16 ."},{"id":2122825543,"microsoftAcademicId":2122825543,"doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9868.2005.00503.x","title":"Regularization and variable selection via the elastic net","authors":[{"LN":"Zou","FN":"Hui","affil":"Stanford University"},{"LN":"Hastie","FN":"Trevor","affil":"Stanford University"}],"year":2005,"journal":"Journal of The Royal Statistical Society Series B-statistical Methodology","references":[1554944419,2135046866,2109363337,2063978378,2157795344,2798909945,2143426320,2074682976,1975900269,2138550913,191129667,158710916,2168561598,2062102668,2079775628,2102760656,2046649434,2023163512,2073738917,2418785680,1774711529,2151499551,2119073761,1608932033,139320271,2024765216,2162942021,17192195,2110162315,2043818707],"citationsCount":10098,"citationContext":{"17192195":["Recently the lasso was used to explain the success of boosting: boosting performs a high dimensional lasso without explicitly using the lasso penalty (Hastie et al., 2001;  Friedman et al., 2004 )."],"139320271":["The lasso is known to be minimax optimal ( Donoho et al., 1995 ) in this case, which implies that the na¨ ive elastic net is not optimal."],"191129667":["The lasso is known to be minimax optimal (Donoho et al., 1995) in this case, which implies that the naı̈ve elastic net is not optimal."],"1554944419":["Σ by a shrunken estimate (Friedman, 1989;  Hastie et al., 2001 ).\u001bThere are well-established methods for choosing such tuning parameters ( Hastie et al.

Whereas a sequential \"p\"-value method fixes the error rate and \"estimates\" its corresponding rejection region, we propose the opposite approach-we \"fix\" the rejection region and then estimate its corresponding error rate.

We describe a joint GWA study ( using the Affymetrix GeneChip 500K Mapping Array Set) undertaken in the British population, which has examined similar to 2,000 individuals for each of 7 major diseases and a shared set of similar to 3,000 controls. Case-control comparisons identified 24 independent association signals at P < 5 X 10(-7): 1 in bipolar disorder, 1 in coronary artery disease, 9 in Crohn's disease, 3 in rheumatoid arthritis, 7 in type 1 diabetes and 3 in type 2 diabetes. On the basis of prior findings and replication studies thus-far completed, almost all of these signals reflect genuine susceptibility effects. We observed association at many previously identified loci, and found compelling evidence that some loci confer risk for more than one of the diseases studied. Across all diseases, we identified a large number of further signals ( including 58 loci with single-point P values between 10(-5) and 5 X 10(-7)) likely to yield additional susceptibility loci. The importance of appropriately large samples was confirmed by the modest effect sizes observed at most loci identified. This study thus represents a thorough validation of the GWA approach. It has also demonstrated that careful use of a shared control group represents a safe and effective approach to GWA analyses of multiple disease phenotypes; has generated a genome-wide genotype database for future studies of common diseases in the British population; and shown that, provided individuals with non-European ancestry are excluded, the extent of population stratification in the British population is generally modest. Our findings offer new avenues for exploring the pathophysiology of these important disorders. We anticipate that our data, results and software, which will be widely available to other investigators, will provide a powerful resource for human genetics research."},{"id":1975900269,"microsoftAcademicId":1975900269,"doi":"10.1198/106186006x113430","title":"Sparse Principal Component Analysis","authors":[{"LN":"Zou","FN":"Hui","affil":"University of Minnesota"},{"LN":"Hastie","FN":"Trevor","affil":"University of Minnesota"},{"LN":"Tibshirani","FN":"Robert","affil":"University of Minnesota"}],"year":2006,"journal":"Journal of Computational and Graphical Statistics","references":[1554944419,2135046866,2063978378,2122825543,2148694408,2138550913,2137476312,2148541040,2062102668,1774711529,2113600901,2006021933,2155974384,1947741949,1978483425,1998409929,184430818,1589483636],"citationsCount":2426,"citationContext":{"1554944419":["as handwritten zip code classiflcation ( Hastie et al. 2001 ) and human face recognition (Hancock\u001bmaximizing variance approach, e.g.  Hastie et al.

In this paper we show how the parameters in the PLS model are affected and to what degree the interpretational ability of the PLS components changes with the amount of Y-orthogonal variation. In both real and synthetic examples, the O2-PLS method provided improved interpretation of the model and gave a good estimate of the pure constituent profiles, and the prediction ability was similar to the standard PLS model. The method is discussed from geometric and algebraic points of view, and a detailed description of this modified O2-PLS method is given and reviewed."},{"id":2108169091,"microsoftAcademicId":2108169091,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pgen.0020190","title":"Population structure and eigenanalysis.","authors":[{"LN":"Patterson","FN":"Nick","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Price","FN":"Alkes","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Price","FN":"Alkes","affil":"Harvard University"},{"LN":"Reich","FN":"David Emil","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Reich","FN":"David Emil","affil":"Harvard University"}],"year":2006,"journal":"PLOS Genetics","references":[2098126593,2157752701,2217809488,2058401000,2158489424,1508985588,2008047653,1543868019,2001587667,1520752838,2039608769,2135732313,1586776267,1997722194,2066459155,2009144436,2019249381,2161644980,1986265706,2171838950,2001115778,2499952289,2059053558,2106084579,2106002960,2798510847,2056946864,2094063883,2050299213,2081014442,2083333719,1857410117,2162372514,2156441380,2137137328,2167587120,2072706575,1990985972,2098360455,153126036,1634806857,2006501615,2183352783,2001242651,2111279973,2056947791],"citationsCount":3068,"citationContext":{"1508985588":["Suppose, for example, that there is a large ‘‘block’’ [35,36] in which markers are in complete LD, and we have genotyped many markers in the block."],"1520752838":["In [22] Johnstone proved his theorem for the case that n,m ! ‘ with m/n bounded away from 0, but this condition was shown in [23] not to be necessary.","Johnstone [22] gives convincing evidence that the fit is good even for values as small as m 1⁄4 5, n 1⁄4 20.","Johnstone in a key paper [22] showed that suitably normalized, and for m, n, large, the distribution of the largest eigenvalue k1 is approximately a distribution discovered by Tracy and Widom [23], which in this paper we call TW.","Our description is taken from [22]."],"1543868019":["We believe they will prove useful both in medical genetics, where population structure may cause spurious disease associations [1,40–43]; and in population genetics, where our statistical methods provide a strong indication of how many axes of variation are meaningful."],"1586776267":["Now we carry out a singular value decomposition on the matrix M.

The importance of the covariation matrix (YX) is pointed out in relation to both the prediction model and the structured noise in both X and Y. Structured noise in X (or Y) is defined as the systematic variation of X (or Y) not linearly correlated with Y (or X). Examples in spectroscopy include baseline, drift and scatter effects. If structured noise is present in X, the existing latent variable regression (LVR) methods, e.g. PLS, will have weakened score-loading correspondence beyond the first component. This negatively affects the interpretation of model parameters such as scores and loadings. The O2-PLS method models and predicts both X and Y and has an integral orthogonal signal correction (OSC) filter that separates the structured noise in X and Y from their joint X-Y covariation used in the prediction model. This leads to a minimal number of predictive components with full score-loading correspondence and also an opportunity to interpret the structured noise. In both a real and a simulated example, O2-PLS and PLS gave very similar predictions of Y. However, the interpretation of the prediction models was clearly improved with O2-PLS, because structured noise was present. In the NIR example, O2-PLS revealed a strong water peak and baseline offset in the structured noise components.

A simple procedure was given there as an FDR controlling procedure for independent test statistics and was shown to be much more powerful than comparable procedures which control the traditional familywise error rate. We prove that this same procedure also controls the false discovery rate when the test statistics have positive regression dependency on each of the test statistics corresponding to the true null hypotheses. This condition for positive dependency is general enough to cover many problems of practical interest, including the comparisons of many treatments with a single control, multivariate normal test statistics with positive correlation matrix and multivariate t. Furthermore, the test statistics may be discrete, and the tested hypotheses composite without posing special difficulties. For all other forms of dependency, a simple conservative modification of the procedure controls the false discovery rate. Thus the range of problems for which a procedure with proven FDR control can be offered is greatly increased. 1.1. Simultaneous hypotheses testing. The control of the increased type I error when testing simultaneously a family of hypotheses is a central issue in the area of multiple comparisons. Rarely are we interested only in whether all hypotheses are jointly true or not, which is the test of the intersection null hypothesis. In most applications, we infer about the individual hypotheses, realizing that some of the tested hypotheses are usually true—we hope not all—and some are not. We wish to decide which ones are not true, indicating (statistical) discoveries. An important such problem is that of multiple endpoints in a clinical trial: a new treatment is compared with an existing one in terms of a large number of potential benefits (endpoints)."},{"id":2121044470,"microsoftAcademicId":2121044470,"doi":"10.2307/4615733","title":"A simple sequentially rejective multiple test procedure","authors":[{"LN":"Holm","FN":"Sture"}],"year":1979,"journal":"Scandinavian Journal of Statistics","references":[2120148445,2796598183,2796512382,2012757283,2158814886,2092931793],"citationsCount":24850,"citationContext":{"2012757283":["(1976) have proposed a closed test procedure, which is a refinement of the Dunnett procedure and which is more powerful.

Profiling of urine samples from more than 4,000 individuals taking part in the INTERMAP epidemiological study demonstrates significant differences in metabolism both from country to country and within populations. Metabolites discriminating across populations were linked to data on blood pressure, a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke. Formate, alanine and hippurate excretion emerged as markers related to blood pressure. Overall the data show that lifestyle is a dominant feature in determining metabolism. This work lays the foundation for a 'metabolome-wide association' approach to molecular epidemiology. This paper presents a large scale, multi-national population-based urinary metabolic profiling analysis from individuals participating in the InterMap study. Metabolic phenotypes are the products of interactions among a variety of factors—dietary, other lifestyle/environmental, gut microbial and genetic1,2,3. We use a large-scale exploratory analytical approach to investigate metabolic phenotype variation across and within four human populations, based on 1H NMR spectroscopy. Metabolites discriminating across populations are then linked to data for individuals on blood pressure, a major risk factor for coronary heart disease and stroke (leading causes of mortality worldwide4). We analyse spectra from two 24-hour urine specimens for each of 4,630 participants from the INTERMAP epidemiological study5, involving 17 population samples aged 40–59 in China, Japan, UK and USA. We show that urinary metabolite excretion patterns for East Asian and western population samples, with contrasting diets, diet-related major risk factors, and coronary heart disease/stroke rates, are significantly differentiated (P < 10-16), as are Chinese/Japanese metabolic phenotypes, and subgroups with differences in dietary vegetable/animal protein and blood pressure6. Among discriminatory metabolites, we quantify four and show association (P < 0.05 to P < 0.0001) of mean 24-hour urinary formate excretion with blood pressure in multiple regression analyses for individuals. Mean 24-hour urinary excretion of alanine (direct) and hippurate (inverse), reflecting diet and gut microbial activities2,7, are also associated with blood pressure of individuals.

A Bayesian hierarchical model is used such that the coefficient of each basis term can be zero with positive prior probability. The presence of basis terms in the model is determined by latent indicator variables. The posterior mean is estimated by Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation because it is computationally intractable to compute the posterior mean analytically unless a small number of basis terms is used. The present article updates the work of Smith and Kohn (1996. Journal of Econometrics 75: 317–344) to take account of work by us and others over the last three years.

We consider the problem of selecting grouped variables (factors) for accurate prediction in regression. Such a problem arises naturally in many practical situations with the multifactor analysis-of-variance problem as the most important and well-known example. Instead of selecting factors by stepwise backward elimination, we focus on the accuracy of estimation and consider extensions of the lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte for factor selection. The lasso, the LARS algorithm and the non-negative garrotte are recently proposed regression methods that can be used to select individual variables.

The lasso penalizes a least squares regression by the sum of the absolute values (L1-norm) of the coefficients. The form of this penalty encourages sparse solutions (with many coefficients equal to 0). We propose the ‘fused lasso’, a generalization that is designed for problems with features that can be ordered in some meaningful way. The fused lasso penalizes the L1-norm of both the coefficients and their successive differences. Thus it encourages sparsity of the coefficients and also sparsity of their differences—i.e. local constancy of the coefficient profile. The fused lasso is especially useful when the number of features p is much greater than N, the sample size. The technique is also extended to the ‘hinge’ loss function that underlies the support vector classifier.We illustrate the methods on examples from protein mass spectroscopy and gene expression data."},{"id":2130517250,"microsoftAcademicId":2130517250,"doi":"10.18637/jss.v022.i04","title":"The ade4 Package: Implementing the Duality Diagram for Ecologists","authors":[{"LN":"Dray","FN":"Stéphane","affil":"Ecologie quantitative et évolutive des communautés"},{"LN":"Dufour","FN":"Anne-Béatrice","affil":"Ecologie quantitative et évolutive des communautés"}],"year":2007,"journal":"Journal of Statistical Software","references":[2102746137,2571444902,2167941657,1537484231,183117647,2062631198,1563636823,2130075028,2165384723,2076616438,2131148901,2104146802,1999597013,2122512858,2146048484,1991596242,2124634097,14315375,1608198518,47803021,2525014720,649490286,1495781036,131298435,2178826457,433965513,2333435078,1976053777,2335682386,2004026774,2092144570],"citationsCount":3035,"citationContext":{"14315375":["To get a more detailed description of these various transformation, the reader could consult NoyMeir (1973); Noy-Meir, Walker, and Williams (1975); Legendre and Gallagher (2001); Dray, Chessel, and Thioulouse (2003)."],"131298435":["For m < r, K[m]Λ 1/2 [m]A[m] > is the best least-squares approximation of X of rank m (Gabriel 1978)."],"183117647":["The reader could consult Chessel et al.

space and time. However, the size of the datasets generated also poses some daunting challenges. In particular, Bayesian clustering algorithms based on pre-defined population genetics models such as the STRUCTURE or BAPS software may not be able to cope with this unprecedented amount of data. Thus, there is a need for less computer-intensive approaches. Multivariate analyses seem particularly appealing as they are specifically devoted to extracting information from large datasets. Unfortunately, currently available multivariate methods still lack some essential features needed to study the genetic structure of natural populations. Results: We introduce the Discriminant Analysis of Principal Components (DAPC), a multivariate method designed to identify and describe clusters of genetically related individuals. When group priors are lacking, DAPC uses sequential K-means and model selection to infer genetic clusters. Our approach allows extracting rich information from genetic data, providing assignment of individuals to groups, a visual assessment of between-population differentiation, and contribution of individual alleles to population structuring. We evaluate the performance of our method using simulated data, which were also analyzed using STRUCTURE as a benchmark. Additionally, we illustrate the method by analyzing microsatellite polymorphism in worldwide human populations and hemagglutinin gene sequence variation in seasonal influenza. Conclusions: Analysis of simulated data revealed that our approach performs generally better than STRUCTURE at characterizing population subdivision. The tools implemented in DAPC for the identification of clusters and graphical representation of between-group structures allow to unravel complex population structures. Our approach is also faster than Bayesian clustering algorithms by several orders of magnitude, and may be applicable to a wider range of datasets."},{"id":2169294950,"microsoftAcademicId":2169294950,"doi":"10.1038/nrg1916","title":"A tutorial on statistical methods for population association

However, the principal components (PCs) can sometimes be difficult to interpret, because they are linear combinations of all the original variables. To facilitate interpretation, sparse PCA produces modified PCs with sparse loadings, i.e. loadings with very few non-zero elements. In this paper, we propose a new sparse PCA method, namely sparse PCA via regularized SVD (sPCA-rSVD). We use the connection of PCA with singular value decomposition (SVD) of the data matrix and extract the PCs through solving a low rank matrix approximation problem. Regularization penalties are introduced to the corresponding minimization problem to promote sparsity in PC loadings. An efficient iterative algorithm is proposed for computation. Two tuning parameter selection methods are discussed. Some theoretical results are established to justify the use of sPCA-rSVD when only the data covariance matrix is available. In addition, we give a modified definition of variance explained by the sparse PCs.

Our results suggest that SSVS, reversible jump MCMC and adaptive shrinkage methods can all work well, but the choice of which method is better will depend on the priors that are used, and also on how they are implemented."},{"id":2097057782,"microsoftAcademicId":2097057782,"doi":"10.1093/bib/bbl016","title":"Partial least squares: a versatile tool for the analysis of high-dimensional genomic data","authors":[{"LN":"Boulesteix","FN":"Anne-Laure","affil":"Ludwig Maximilian University of Munich"},{"LN":"Strimmer","FN":"Korbinian","affil":"Statistics"}],"year":2006,"journal":"Briefings in Bioinformatics","references":[1480376833,2109363337,2147246240,2131994307,2087684630,2138550913,1989076816,2097413644,2159400887,2403035479,2164583936,74388425,2079775628,2133199783,2013416277,2078129874,2166446427,1976251851,2163490846,2160333357,2168117806,1993895874,2096158882,2093109772,2104969279,1569114583,2144405862,2113847750,2015961513,2107357525,1970502168,2146320559,2118317777,2068752849,2903718010,2123672572,2142894222,2127782890,2160064408,1989539998,2165093044,2106002880,2002156658,1991680649,2121159025,2117220087,2162384717,184513177,2090782670,2083414440,2028631831,2009155924,2050360262,2058738984,2169200817,148149851,2028306844,2163799583,2149877551,2156916561,21913732,20683381,150563991,2122011654,2037333971,1991181801,2471288897,1973079098,2588980052,1994154522,2011683226,1986882662,174064755,1978421014],"citationsCount":639,"citationContext":{"20683381":["Wold [1–3]."],"21913732":["Early references are, e.g., Wold [ 7 ], Wold [8], or Wold [9]."],"74388425":["proportional hazard regression model (PH model) by Cox [ 40 ] may not be applied di-"],"148149851":["saccharomyces cerevisiaecan be found in Datta [ 26 ]."],"150563991":["As suggested in [64], Park et al."],"174064755":[", Wold [7], Wold [8], or Wold [9]."],"184513177":["A similar approach is proposed by Bastien [54] and studied from a methodological point of view in [55]."],"1480376833":["ods, see e.g. Hastie et al.

In multivariate analysis a common way to inspect the relationship between two sets of variables based on their correlation is canonical correlation analysis, which determines linear combinations of all variables of each type with maximal correlation between the two linear combinations. However, in high dimensional data analysis, when the number of variables under consideration exceeds tens of thousands, linear combinations of the entire sets of features may lack biological plausibility and interpretability. In addition, insufficient sample size may lead to computational problems, inaccurate estimates of parameters and non-generalizable results. These problems may be solved by selecting sparse subsets of variables, i.e. obtaining sparse loadings in the linear combinations of variables of each type. In this paper we present Sparse Canonical Correlation Analysis (SCCA) which examines the relationships between two types of variables and provides sparse solutions that include only small subsets of variables of each type by maximizing the correlation between the subsets of variables of different types while performing variable selection. We also present an extension of SCCA - adaptive SCCA.

We approximate genome-wide significance thresholds in contemporary West African, East Asian and European populations by simulating sequence data, based on all polymorphisms as well as for a range of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) selection criteria.

Testing these on a set of 2,000 genes in four tissues, we demonstrate that our methods are more powerful than traditional approaches in revealing the true complexity of the eQTL landscape at the systems-level. Highlighting the power of our method, we identified a two-eQTL model (cis/trans) for the Hopx gene that was experimentally validated and was not detected by conventional approaches. We showed common genetic regulation of gene expression across four tissues for ∼27% of transcripts, providing >5 fold increase in eQTLs detection when compared with single tissue analyses at 5% FDR level. These findings provide a new opportunity to uncover complex genetic regulatory mechanisms controlling global gene expression while the generality of our modelling approach makes it adaptable to other model systems and humans, with broad application to analysis of multiple intermediate and whole-body phenotypes."},{"id":2011471859,"microsoftAcademicId":2011471859,"doi":"10.1198/016214507000000121","title":"Shotgun Stochastic Search for “Large p” Regression","authors":[{"LN":"Hans","FN":"Chris","affil":"Ohio State University"},{"LN":"Dobra","FN":"Adrian","affil":"University of Washington"},{"LN":"West","FN":"Mike","affil":"Duke University"}],"year":2007,"journal":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","references":[2170989872,2109972881,2106706098,2083875149,2168561598,2089763487,2027255954,2007069447,2108043112,2057331441,2112814716,171292237,2330192890,2151832869,2012328630,2102000647,2166624680,2160193995,2159347337,1551107844,1989885743,2085573033,2155092357,2169569769,199903871,2569199996,2317866228,2596938854,2168832308,2468921417,2115770600,2103857951,2118723175,93243759],"citationsCount":219,"citationContext":{"199903871":["In higher dimensional problems, stepwise methods are prone to entrapment in local maxima of model space (Hocking, 1976), and often do not provide an adequate representation of the model space with the increasingly complex patterns of collinearity that are typical with many variables."],"1989885743":["for Bayesian CART models, by  Wong et al.

This problem poses significant challenges due to high dimensionality of both the gene expression and the genomic marker data. We propose a multivariate response regression approach with simultaneous variable selection and dimension reduction for the eQTL mapping problem. Transcripts with similar expression are clustered into groups, and their expression profiles are viewed as a multivariate response. Then, we employ our recently developed sparse partial least-squares regression methodology to select markers associated with each cluster of genes. We demonstrate with extensive simulations that our eQTL mapping with multivariate response sparse partial least-squares regression (M-SPLS eQTL) method overcomes the issue of multiple transcript- or marker-specific analyses, thereby avoiding potential elevation of type I error. Additionally, joint analysis of multiple transcripts by multivariate response regression increases power for detecting weak linkages. We illustrate that M-SPLS eQTL compares competitively with other approaches and has a number of significant advantages, including the ability to handle highly correlated genotype data and computational efficiency.

The data suggest that land plants and vertebrates, which have extensive DNA methylation, are under strong selective pressure to repress TEs, because of their sexual mode of reproduction. Unicellular animals and fungi that reproduce asexually are more likely to lose TE methylation. Although gene body methylation is evolutionarily ancient, it is also mutagenic, and so loss of this pathway has been relatively common and occurred early in fungal evolution and later in several plant and animal lineages.\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1186366\n [2]: /lookup/volpage/328/837?iss=5980"},{"id":2116585889,"microsoftAcademicId":2116585889,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/btr521","title":"adegenet 1.3-1","authors":[{"LN":"Jombart","FN":"Thibaut","affil":"Imperial College London"},{"LN":"Ahmed","FN":"Ismaïl","affil":"Imperial College London"}],"year":2011,"journal":"Bioinformatics","references":[2161633633,2151409320,2146290595,2161245845,1977601452,2117801354,2122606427,1993507775],"citationsCount":1269,"abstract":"Summary: While the R software is becoming a standard for the analysis of genetic data, classical population genetics tools are being challenged by the increasing availability of genomic sequences.

Previous theoretical suggestions have yet to be validated in practice, whereas permutation testing does not resolve a discrepancy between the genomewide multiplicity of the experiment and the subset of markers actually tested. We used genotypes from the Wellcome Trust Case-Control Consortium to estimate a genomewide significance threshold for the UK Caucasian population. We subsampled the genotypes at increasing densities, using permutation to estimate the nominal P-value for 5% family-wise error. By extrapolating to infinite density, we estimated the genomewide significance threshold to be about 7.2 × 10−8. To reduce the computation time, we considered Patterson's eigenvalue estimator of the effective number of tests, but found it to be an order of magnitude too low for multiplicity correction. However, by fitting a Beta distribution to the minimum P-value from permutation replicates, we showed that the effective number is a useful heuristic and suggest that its estimation in this context is an open problem. We conclude that permutation is still needed to obtain genomewide significance thresholds, but with subsampling, extrapolation and estimation of an effective number of tests, the threshold can be standardized for all studies of the same population."},{"id":2149566602,"microsoftAcademicId":2149566602,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.0504609102","title":"Significance analysis of time course microarray experiments","authors":[{"LN":"Storey","FN":"John D.","affil":"University of Washington"},{"LN":"Xiao","FN":"Wenzhong","affil":"Stanford University"},{"LN":"Leek","FN":"Jeffrey T.","affil":"University of Washington"},{"LN":"Tompkins","FN":"Ronald G.","affil":"Harvard University"},{"LN":"Davis","FN":"Ronald W.","affil":"Stanford University"}],"year":2005,"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","references":[2102865756,2150926065,2157795344,1964895626,2145816995,2105381419,2008233728,2153675946,27406447,2148541040,1625166229,2133210805,1981688857,1988997815,2032528091,2159578516,1650504959,1984080040,2099337407,2087594396,2120833234,2120391288,2042345167,1651166025,1963827794,2144510733,2070193928,2160660032],"citationsCount":641,"abstract":"Characterizing the genome-wide dynamic regulation of gene expression is important and will be of much interest in the future.

The paper develops the first computationally efficient method for direct generalized additive model smoothness selection.

Methods based on fully parametric mixture models are available, but lack of fit in some examples indicates that more flexible models may be beneficial. Existing, more flexible, mixture models work at the level of one-dimensional gene-specific summary statistics, and so when there are relatively few measurements per gene these methods may not provide sensitive detectors of differential expression. We propose a hierarchical mixture model to provide methodology that is both sensitive in detecting differential expression and sufficiently flexible to account for the complex variability of normalized microarray data. EM-based algorithms are used to fit both parametric and semiparametric versions of the model. We restrict attention to the two-sample comparison problem; an experiment involving Affymetrix microarrays and yeast translation provides the motivating case study. Gene-specific posterior probabilities of differential expression form the basis of statistical inference; they define short gene lists and false discovery rates. Compared to several competing methodologies, the proposed methodology exhibits good operating characteristics in a simulation study, on the analysis of spike-in data, and in a cross-validation calculation."},{"id":2082253757,"microsoftAcademicId":2082253757,"doi":"10.1186/1471-2105-10-34","title":"Sparse canonical methods for biological data integration: application to a cross-platform study","authors":[{"LN":"Cao","FN":"Kim Anh Lê","affil":"University of Toulouse"},{"LN":"Cao","FN":"Kim Anh Lê","affil":"Institut national de la recherche agronomique"},{"LN":"Martin","FN":"Pascal G.P.","affil":"Institut national de la recherche agronomique"},{"LN":"Robert-Granié","FN":"Christèle","affil":"Institut national de la recherche agronomique"},{"LN":"Besse","FN":"Philippe","affil":"University of Toulouse"}],"year":2009,"journal":"BMC Bioinformatics","references":[2135046866,2122825543,1975900269,1989076816,2063011414,2018843280,2137082708,2044809283,1537484231,2122128696,2113600901,1976251851,1992452843,1969435618,1880944740,2036010272,2058382695,2076616438,2108960802,1990745503,190455497,2228808639,2097553067,2076717151,2127810129,1964529181,136279867,29779864,2082847378,2128156296,1985774086,2020286436,2104504332,2017634446,2060643327,2025341678],"citationsCount":227,"citationContext":{"29779864":["This results in two sets of axes, where the first pair of axes are maximally co-variant, and are orthogonal to the next pair [ 24 ]."],"190455497":["Many PLS algorithms exist, not only for different shapes of data (SIMPLS, [18], PLS1 and PLS2 [1], PLS-SVD [19]) but also for different aims (predictive, like PLS2, or modelling, like PLS-mode A, see [10,20, 21 ]).\u001bTo do so, the authors used the PLS-mode A formulation [20, 21 ] to introduce penalties."],"1537484231":["Samples are represented with the scores or latent variable vectors, in a superimposed manner, as proposed in the R package ade4 [ 25 ], first to show how samples are clustered based on their biological characteristics, and second to measure if both data sets strongly agree according to the applied approach."],"1880944740":["Easier interpretable graphics are then obtained, as shown in the R package cca [ 14 ].\u001bVariables are represented on correlation circles, as previously proposed by [ 14 ]."],"1964529181":["These graphical outputs proposed by [ 31 ] improve the interpretability of the results in the following manner."],"1969435618":["Methodological aspects and evaluation of sPLS in a regression framework were presented in [ 9 ].\u001b[ 9 ] proposed a sparse PLS approach (sPLS) based on a PLS-SVD variant, so as to penalize both loading vectors a h and bh simultaneously.\u001bBoth regression and canonical deflation modes were proposed for sPLS [ 9 ].\u001bThe regression mode has already been discussed in [ 9 ] with a thorough biological interpretation of the results.\u001bThe same strategy will be used for sPLS (see also [ 9 ] where the issue of tuning sPLS parameters is addressed)."],"1975900269":["[10] proposed a sparse penalized variant of CCA using Elastic Net [8, 22 ] for a canonical framework.\u001bthe number of variables to select), as previously proposed for sparse PCA by [ 22 ,23]-see the elasticnet R package for example, and hence to rely on the biologists needs."],"1976251851":["Many PLS algorithms exist, not only for different shapes of data (SIMPLS, [ 18 ], PLS1 and PLS2 [1], PLS-SVD [19]) but also for different aims (predictive, like PLS2, or modelling, like PLS-mode A, see [10,20,21])."],"1985774086":["Only the LOXIMVI cell line, which lacks melanin and several typical markers of melanoma cells [ 30 ] did not cluster with all ME cell lines (Figure 2).

It is however an important and fundamental issue that will be widely encountered in post genomic studies, when simultaneously analyzing transcriptomics, proteomics and metabolomics data using different platforms, so as to understand the mutual interactions between the different data sets. In this high dimensional setting, variable selection is crucial to give interpretable results.

It is, perhaps, less widely appreciated that Sir Ronald, who was against the import­ance of random fixation, was also the first to consider it theoretically under the name of ‘Hagedoorn effect’ (Fisher 1922). The reason that led Fisher to a negative conclusion is summarized in the relationship between the chance of success of the rare mutant and its selective advantage. This relationship is given in detail in his 1930 paper on the distribution of gene ratios for rare mutations, in which it is shown that the chance of success rises almost proportionately to the selective advantage, in such a way that even small changes in the selective co­efficient affect deeply the chance for success. Clearly, the overall chance with which mutants showing selective disadvantage will be fixed depends also on the relative frequency with which such mutants arise, that is, on the distribution of selective coefficients for mutations."},{"id":2119160928,"microsoftAcademicId":2119160928,"doi":"10.1111/j.1467-9868.2010.00749.x","title":"Fast stable restricted maximum likelihood and marginal likelihood estimation of semiparametric generalized linear models","authors":[{"LN":"Wood","FN":"Simon N.","affil":"University of Bath"}],"year":2011,"journal":"Journal of The Royal Statistical Society Series B-statistical Methodology","references":[1556631438,2568686901,2082246284,1990420052,2065540158,1982585616,2911383389,2140308441,2009499611,2119047368,2109785413,2099372171,2134080536,2140170995,2000084758,2021436645,2134874509,2801490189,2133944729,2025266808,2008843339,2010074546,2119753634,2048395053,2162978560,2059586969,2067342226,2022449465,2034390858,2056735347,2059122256,1965179593,1996005750,2149791993,1981569082,1988300874,2002355073,1570736779,2088946168,2088573357,2081346250],"citationsCount":2549,"abstract":"Summary.  Recent work by Reiss and Ogden provides a theoretical basis for sometimes preferring restricted maximum likelihood (REML) to generalized cross-validation (GCV) for smoothing parameter selection in semiparametric regression. However, existing REML or marginal likelihood (ML) based methods for semiparametric generalized linear models (GLMs) use iterative REML or ML estimation of the smoothing parameters of working linear approximations to the GLM. Such indirect schemes need not converge and fail to do so in a non-negligible proportion of practical analyses. By contrast, very reliable prediction error criteria smoothing parameter selection methods are available, based on direct optimization of GCV, or related criteria, for the GLM itself. Since such methods directly optimize properly defined functions of the smoothing parameters, they have much more reliable convergence properties. The paper develops the first such method for REML or ML estimation of smoothing parameters. A Laplace approximation is used to obtain an approximate REML or ML for any GLM, which is suitable for efficient direct optimization. This REML or ML criterion requires that Newton–Raphson iteration, rather than Fisher scoring, be used for GLM fitting, and a computationally stable approach to this is proposed. The REML or ML criterion itself is optimized by a Newton method, with the derivatives required obtained by a mixture of implicit differentiation and direct methods. The method will cope with numerical rank deficiency in the fitted model and in fact provides a slight improvement in numerical robustness on the earlier method of Wood for prediction error criteria based smoothness selection. Simulation results suggest that the new REML and ML methods offer some improvement in mean-square error performance relative to GCV or Akaike's information criterion in most cases, without the small number of severe undersmoothing failures to which Akaike's information criterion and GCV are prone. This is achieved at the same computational cost as GCV or Akaike's information criterion. The new approach also eliminates the convergence failures of previous REML- or ML-based approaches for penalized GLMs and usually has lower computational cost than these alternatives. Example applications are presented in adaptive smoothing, scalar on function regression and generalized additive model selection."},{"id":2117386992,"microsoftAcademicId":2117386992,"doi":"10.1126/science.1110359","title":"Complement factor H variant increases the risk of age-related macular degeneration.","authors":[{"LN":"Haines","FN":"Jonathan L.","affil":"VA Medical Center"},{"LN":"Hauser","FN":"Michael A.","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Schmidt","FN":"Silke","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Scott","FN":"William K.","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Olson","FN":"Lana M.","affil":"VA Medical Center"},{"LN":"Gallins","FN":"Paul","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Spencer","FN":"Kylee L.","affil":"VA Medical Center"},{"LN":"Kwan","FN":"Shu Ying","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Noureddine","FN":"Maher","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Gilbert","FN":"John R.","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Schnetz-Boutaud","FN":"Nathalie","affil":"VA Medical Center"},{"LN":"Agarwal","FN":"Anita","affil":"VA Medical Center"},{"LN":"Postel","FN":"Eric A.","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Pericak-Vance","FN":"Margaret A.","affil":"Duke University"}],"year":2005,"journal":"Science","references":[2016584341,2074286693,1883306593,2021311336,1968744211,2168511422,2076794120,2096201017,2144588016,2006264045,2018133348,64158717,1809957428,1573040585,2024729125,2024786751,2161469264,2081872210,1992859141,1970276449,1554545321],"citationsCount":2521,"abstract":"Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a leading cause of visual impairment and blindness in the elderly whose etiology remains largely unknown.

For example, microarray experiments generate large multiplicity problems in which thousands of hypotheses are tested simultaneously. Westfall and Young (1993) propose resampling-based p-value adjustment procedures which are highly relevant to microarray experiments. This article discusses dierent criteria for error control in resampling-based multiple testing, including (a) the family wise error rate of Westfall and Young (1993) and (b) the false discovery rate developed by Benjamini and Hochberg (1995), both from a frequentist viewpoint; and (c) the positive false discovery rate of Storey (2002a), which has a Bayesian motivation.

We review and discuss three analytic methods to combine preliminary GWAS statistics to identify genes, alleles, and pathways for deeper investigations. Meta-analysis seeks to pool information from multiple GWAS to increase the chances of finding true positives among the false positives and provides a way to combine associations across GWAS, even when the original data are unavailable. Testing for epistasis within a single GWAS study can identify the stronger results that are revealed when genes interact.

Currently, typical genome-wide association studies measure hundreds of thousands, or millions, of genetic variants (SNPs), in thousands or tens of thousands of individuals, and attempt to identify regions harboring SNPs that affect some phenotype or outcome of interest. This goal can naturally be cast as a variable selection regression problem, with the SNPs as the covariates in the regression. Characteristic features of genome-wide association studies include the following: (i) a focus primarily on identifying relevant variables, rather than on prediction; and (ii) many relevant covariates may have tiny effects, making it effectively impossible to confidently identify the complete \"correct\" subset of variables. Taken together, these factors put a premium on having interpretable measures of confidence for individual covariates being included in the model, which we argue is a strength of BVSR compared with alternatives such as penalized regression methods. Here we focus primarily on analysis of quantitative phenotypes, and on appropriate prior specification for BVSR in this setting, emphasizing the idea of considering what the priors imply about the total proportion of variance in outcome explained by relevant covariates.

King Jordan,<br><br><br><br><br>//<br><br><br><br><br><br> //<br><br><br><br> Abstract<br><br> DNA methylation of promoter sequences is a repressive epigenetic mark that down-regulates gene expression. However, DNA methylation is more prevalent within gene-bodies than seen for promoters, and gene-body methylation has been observed to be positively correlated with gene expression levels. This paradox remains unexplained, and accordingly the role of DNA methylation in gene-bodies is poorly understood. We addressed the presence and role of human gene-body DNA methylation using a meta-analysis of human genome-wide methylation, expression and chromatin data sets. Methylation is associated with transcribed regions as genic sequences have higher levels of methylation than intergenic or promoter sequences. We also find that the relationship between gene-body DNA methylation and expression levels is non-monotonic and bell-shaped. Mid-level expressed genes have the highest levels of gene-body methylation, whereas the most lowly and highly expressed sets of genes both have low levels of methylation. While gene-body methylation can be seen to efficiently repress the initiation of intragenic transcription, the vast majority of methylated sites within genes are not associated with intragenic promoters. In fact, highly expressed genes initiate the most intragenic transcription, which is inconsistent with the previously held notion that gene-body methylation serves to repress spurious intragenic transcription to allow for efficient transcriptional elongation. These observations lead us to propose a model to explain the presence of human gene-body methylation. This model holds that the repression of intragenic transcription by gene-body methylation is largely epiphenomenal, and suggests that gene-body methylation levels are predominantly shaped via the accessibility of the DNA to methylating enzyme complexes."},{"id":2022481980,"microsoftAcademicId":2022481980,"doi":"10.1038/ng0508-491","title":"Principal component analysis of genetic data","authors":[{"LN":"Reich","FN":"David","affil":"Harvard University"},{"LN":"Price","FN":"Alkes L","affil":"Harvard University"},{"LN":"Patterson","FN":"Nick","affil":"Massachusetts Institute of Technology"}],"year":2008,"journal":"Nature Genetics","references":[2157752701,2108169091,2001587667,2102714321,1974611538,2104183609,2058035594,2140202326,2003605263,2050897245,2051604752,2072706575,2001294676],"citationsCount":200,"citationContext":{"2001587667":[", and they eventually analyzed about 100 protein polymorphisms that had been measured in many human population"]},"abstract":"Principal component analysis (PCA) has been a useful tool for analysis of genetic data, particularly in studies of human migration.

However, microarray and RNA-seq analysis grouped all the other samples into two major classes based on maturity rather than organ identity, namely, the vegetative/ green and mature/woody categories. This division represents a fundamental transcriptomic reprogramming during the maturation process and was highlighted by three statistical approaches identifying the transcriptional relationships among samples (correlation analysis), putative biomarkers (O2PLS-DA approach), and sets of strongly and consistently expressed genes that define groups (topics) of similar samples (biclustering analysis). Gene coexpression analysis indicated that the mature/woody developmental program results from the reiterative coactivation of pathways that are largely inactive in vegetative/green tissues, often involving the coregulation of clusters of neighboring genes and global regulation based on codon preference. This global transcriptomic reprogramming during maturation has not been observed in herbaceous annual species and may be a defining characteristic of perennial woody plants."},{"id":2027192605,"microsoftAcademicId":2027192605,"doi":"10.1021/pr100798r","title":"Metabolome-wide association study identifies multiple biomarkers that discriminate north and south Chinese populations at differing risks of cardiovascular disease: INTERMAP study.","authors":[{"LN":"Yap","FN":"Ivan K.

Contrary to initial interpretations, these correlations are not necessarily only between neighboring metabolites in the metabolic network. Most metabolites that participate in common reactions are not correlated in this way, while some non-neighboring metabolites are highly correlated. Here we investigate the origin of such correlations using metabolic control analysis and computer simulation of biochemical networks. A series of cases is identified which lead to high correlation between metabolite pairs in replicate measurement. These are (1) chemical equilibrium, (2) mass conservation, (3) asymmetric control distribution, and (4) unusually high variance in the expression of a single gene. The importance of identifying metabolite correlations within a physiological state and changes of correlation between different states is discussed in the context of systems biology."},{"id":2148870018,"microsoftAcademicId":2148870018,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bts669","title":"A Lasso multi-marker mixed model for association mapping with population structure correction","authors":[{"LN":"Rakitsch","FN":"Barbara","affil":"Max Planck Society"},{"LN":"Lippert","FN":"Christoph","affil":"Max Planck Society"},{"LN":"Stegle","FN":"Oliver","affil":"Max Planck Society"},{"LN":"Borgwardt","FN":"Karsten","affil":"Max Planck Society"}],"year":2013,"journal":"Bioinformatics","references":[1480376833,1746819321,2135046866,2157752701,2155496693,2041467022,2134036574,2088486634,2137797806,1980168725,2141916112,2127684760,2130542470,2079927753,2562162676,2152885121,2009588715,2122189635,2127601863,2080183225,2162683818,1991189546,2114643899,2157291679,2962727278,2146374090,2030444684,2095741373,2112495313,2097349182,2082213488,2035864960,2003747371,2102751249,2116100197,2097209031,2074693857,2060546774,2147272585,1997494129,2127655643,2120465937,2336392079,2097078077,2951982552,2026228219,2736748674,2108495711,2045396767],"citationsCount":90,"citationContext":{"1480376833":["Due to the small sample size, cross-validation can underestimate the true explained variance [9]."],"1746819321":["The predictive distribution can be derived by conditioning the joint distribution over all individuals on the training individuals [31], resulting in a Gaussian predictive distribution p(y |y,S,S) = N (y |μ,Σ), with"],"1980168725":["For univariate single-SNP mixed models, efficient optimization of δ for each SNP can be done by recently proposed computational tricks [18, 45]."],"1991189546":["It is known [44] that flowering is strikingly associated with population structure, which explains why the LMM-Lasso already captured a substantial fraction (45."],"1997494129":["Similarly, in genetic analyses of gene expression, K can be fit to capture and correct for the confounding effect of gene expression heterogeneity [19, 6]."],"2003747371":["To measure for the predictive power, we assessed which fraction of the total phenotypic variation can be explained by genotype using different methods [25]."],"2009588715":["While these approaches can be effective in some settings, principal components cannot account for family structure or cryptic relatedness [29]."],"2026228219":["Instead, population structure in the sample is difficult to avoid and even in a seemingly stratified sample, the extent of hidden structure cannot be ignored [24]."],"2030444684":["thaliana dataset [12] consisting of 1196 plants."],"2035864960":["The relatedness between individuals ranges in a wide spectrum leading to a complex population structure [26]."],"2041467022":["If multiple variants contribute to phenotype variation in an additive fashion, simple methods that assess the significance of individual loci independently are likely to fall short: masking effects between causal SNPs can limit mapping power, with relevant loci not reaching genome-wide significance levels [21].","Nevertheless, the statistical analysis of these genetic data has proven to be challenging, not least because single genetic variants rarely explain larger fractions of phenotype variability, and hence, individual effect sizes are small [21, 20]."],"2045396767":["In [5], as sparse random effect model is proposed, where the markers are modeled as random Lasso effects."],"2060546774":["Realized relationship matrix and relationship to Bayesian linear regression From a Bayesian perspective, employing the realized relationship matrix as the covariance matrix is equivalent to integrating over all SNPs in a linear additive model with an independent Gaussian prior over the weights N (β |0, σ gI) [7]."],"2074693857":["There is a vast amount of literature using a ‘1-regularized approach for genome-wide associations studies (Kim and Xing, 2009;

In traits with simple Mendelian architectures, single polymorphic loci explain a significant fraction of the phenotypic variability. However, many traits of interest seem to be subject to multifactorial control by groups of genetic loci. Accurate detection of such multivariate associations is non-trivial and often compromised by limited statistical power. At the same time, confounding influences, such as population structure, cause spurious association signals that result in false-positive findings.\r\n\r\nResults: We propose linear mixed models LMM-Lasso, a mixed model that allows for both multi-locus mapping and correction for confounding effects. Our approach is simple and free of tuning parameters; it effectively controls for population structure and scales to genome-wide datasets. LMM-Lasso simultaneously discovers likely causal variants and allows for multi-marker–based phenotype prediction from genotype. We demonstrate the practical use of LMM-Lasso in genome-wide association studies in Arabidopsis thaliana and linkage mapping in mouse, where our method achieves significantly more accurate phenotype prediction for 91% of the considered phenotypes. At the same time, our model dissects the phenotypic variability into components that result from individual single nucleotide polymorphism effects and population structure. Enrichment of known candidate genes suggests that the individual associations retrieved by LMM-Lasso are likely to be genuine.\r\n\r\nAvailability: Code available under http://webdav.tuebingen.\r\n\r\nmpg.de/u/karsten/Forschung/research.html.\r\n\r\nContact:rakitsch@tuebingen.mpg.de, ippert@microsoft.com or stegle@ebi.ac.uk\r\n\r\nSupplementary information:Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online."},{"id":2122159287,"microsoftAcademicId":2122159287,"doi":"10.1007/978-1-4615-7070-7_8","title":"Generalized Additive Models: Some Applications","authors":[{"LN":"Hastie","FN":"Trevor","affil":"South African Medical Research Council"},{"LN":"Tibshirani","FN":"Robert","affil":"University of Toronto"}],"year":1987,"journal":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","references":[1528905581,2166163519,2024081693,2091886411,2030748132,2145147745,2135157209,2800289289,2112081648,1510444525,2020214980,25587163,2801490189,2043499708,2121203842,1979519992,1997927050,2093281118,2094212611,2903718010,25566965,1979816698,2078309027,2107784689,1490266132,219251239,2070574062,2798289755,1978153422,48272409,1517050824,2126707243,41836970,284804314,2061892242,26128386,2015322608,1480152237,2083226887,2410241626],"citationsCount":429,"citationContext":{"25566965":["Although the spans can be picked by cross-validation (Friedman and Stuetzle 1982; Stone 1974), we tend to use intuitively reasonable spans for data exploration, a typical value being in the range 10%-50%."],"1480152237":["The baseline study is to be followed by a two-level intervention program (Rossouw et al. 1983)."],"1490266132":["(Hastie and Tibshirani 1986b).

Understanding of the global function of the living organism can be achieved by integration of ‘omics’ approaches including metabonomics, genomics, transcriptomics and proteomics, increasing the complexity of the full data sets. Multivariate statistical approaches are well suited to extract the characterizing metabolic information associated with each level of dynamic process. In this review, we discuss techniques that have evolved from principal component analysis and partial least squares (PLS) methods with a focus on improved interpretation and modeling with respect to biomarker recovery and data visualization in the context of metabonomic applications. Visualization is of paramount importance to investigate complex metabolic signatures, the power and potential of which is illustrated with key papers. Recent improvements based on the removal of orthogonal variation are discussed in terms of interpretation enhancement, and are supported by relevant applications. Flexibility of PLS methods in general and of O-PLS in particular allows implementation of derivative methods such as O2-PLS, O-PLS-variance components, nonlinear methods, and batch modeling to improve analysis of complex data sets, which facilitates extraction of information related to subtle biological processes. These approaches can be used to address issues present in complex multi-factorial data sets. Thus, we highlight the key advantages and limitations of the different latent variable applications for top-down systems biology and assess the differences between the methods available.

In regression, stochastic search variable selection with Bayesian model averaging offers a cure for this robustness issue but at the expense of requiring very many predictors. Here we look at Bayes model averaging incorporating variable selection for prediction. This offers similar mean-square errors of prediction but with a vastly reduced predictor space. This can greatly aid the interpretation of the model. It also reduces the cost if measured variables have costs. The development here uses decision theory in the context of the multivariate general linear model. In passing, this reduced predictor space Bayes model averaging is contrasted with single-model approximations. A fast algorithm for updating regressions in the Markov chain Monte Carlo searches for posterior inference is developed, allowing many more variables than observations to be contemplated. We discuss the merits of absolute rather than proportionate shrinkage in regression, especially when there are more variables than observations. The methodology is illustrated on a set of spectroscopic data used for measuring the amounts of different sugars in an aqueous solution.

We address the problem of selecting which variables should be included in the fixed and random components of logistic mixed effects models for correlated data. A fully Bayesian variable selection is implemented using a stochastic search Gibbs sampler to estimate the exact model-averaged posterior distribution.

The choice of the parametric family that defines the set of proposal distributions is critical for good performance. In this paper, we present such a parametric family for adaptive sampling on high dimensional binary spaces.\r\n\r\nA practical motivation for this problem is variable selection in a linear regression context. We want to sample from a Bayesian posterior distribution on the model space using an appropriate version of Sequential Monte Carlo.\r\n\r\nRaw versions of Sequential Monte Carlo are easily implemented using binary vectors with independent components. For high dimensional problems, however, these simple proposals do not yield satisfactory results.

Here we present a novel modeling strategy to estimate the propensity of a genetic marker to influence several expression traits at the same time, based on a hierarchical formulation of related regressions. We implement this hierarchical regression model in a Bayesian framework using a stochastic search algorithm, HESS, that efficiently probes sparse subsets of genetic markers in a high-dimensional data matrix to identify hotspots and to pinpoint the individual genetic effects (eQTL). Simulating complex regulatory scenarios, we demonstrate that our method outperforms current state-of-the-art approaches, in particular when the number of transcripts is large.

Previous attempts at identifying this species have resulted in widely different conclusions in regards to its native range, source, and biology. We identify this highly invasive pest species as Nylanderia fulva (Mayr) using morphometric data measured from 14 characters, molecular sequence data consisting of 4,669 aligned nucleotide sites from six independent loci and comparison with type specimens. This identification will allow for the study and control of this emerging pest species to proceed unencumbered by taxonomic uncertainty.

In this study, we quantified the level of methylation of six genes associated with the Wnt signalling pathway (adenomatous polyposis coli, DKK1, WIF1, SFRP1, SFRP2 and SFRP5) together with long-interspersed nuclear element-1 as a surrogate for global methylation. DNA methylation was analysed in 260 individual colorectal crypts obtained from eight female patients with no evidence of colorectal disease and five with colorectal cancer. Significant variation in methylation levels for each of the six genes existed between crypts from the same biopsy. The variation in both global and gene-specific CGI methylation between crypts from the same individual was significantly less than that between individuals. Bisulphite sequencing provided insight into the mechanism of aberrant methylation showing that CGI methylation occurs in an ‘all-or-none’ manner by the directional spreading of methylation from further upstream. Univariate statistical analyses revealed that there were significant differences in crypt-specific methylation associated with both aging and disease status. A multivariate statistical modelling approach was able to distinguish both subject age and health status based on crypt-specific methylation profiles. Our results indicate that the differential methylation of genes associated with the Wnt signalling pathway affecting individual morphologically normal crypts may contribute to the age-dependent generation of the colonic field defect and, in combination with mutations, to the stepwise development of colorectal neoplasia."},{"id":2069728797,"microsoftAcademicId":2069728797,"doi":"10.1093/bioinformatics/bth285","title":"A mixture model-based strategy for selecting sets of genes in multiclass response microarray experiments","authors":[{"LN":"Broët","FN":"Philippe","affil":"French Institute of Health and Medical Research"},{"LN":"Lewin","FN":"Alex","affil":"Imperial College London"},{"LN":"Richardson","FN":"Sylvia","affil":"Imperial College London"},{"LN":"Dalmasso","FN":"Cyril","affil":"French Institute of Health and Medical Research"},{"LN":"Magdelenat","FN":"Henri","affil":"Curie Institute"}],"year":2004,"journal":"Bioinformatics","references":[2110065044,1579271636,1964895626,1994702090,2105381419,2008233728,1997917263,2074089196,2125905177,2038885294,2065912508,587118055,1982516880,2134696273,1996655954,2152012752,2170264612,2130530904,2137807839,2133807679,2005107355,2118727666],"citationsCount":80,"citationContext":{"1579271636":[",wG, respectively (McLachlan and Peel, 2000)."],"1964895626":["We illustrate the performance in estimating FDR and FNR using simulated microarray datasets in Section 3 and compare our estimates with those obtained using the q-value approach proposed by Storey (Storey, 2001; Storey and Tibshirani, 2003)."],"1982516880":["(Hochberg and Tamhane, 1987; Westfall and Young, 1993)."],"1996655954":["Here, we do not elaborate on data preprocessing since it is not our main purpose [for a detailed discussion on data preprocessing strategies see  Speed (2003) ]."],"1997917263":["(Hochberg and Tamhane, 1987; Westfall and Young, 1993)."],"2005107355":["The normal mixture model has been successfully used in recent microarray studies in a variety of contexts (Lee et al., 2000; Pan et al., 2002; McLachlan et al., 2002; Broët et al., 2002).","These constraints led to a mixture model, which is different from the one developed previously (Broët et al., 2002) for differential expression and is not fitted by standard implementations for estimating mixtures in a maximum-likelihood set-up using the EM algorithm, as provided e.","This is in contrast to our previous work on two class comparison (Broët et al., 2002) in which a mixture was used to model differential expression and the components interpreted to form clusters corresponding to different levels of expression.","This new approach is based on a fully Bayesian mixture model, presented in Section 2, which extends previous work (Broët et al., 2002) on two class comparison in microarray experiments."],"2008233728":["1 Dataset We analyzed the cDNA microarray dataset publicly available from the breast cancer study conducted by Hedenfalk et al.

In these experiments, though the null hypothesis is simple, there are typically many patterns of gene expression changes across the different classes that led to complex alternatives. In this paper, we propose a new strategy for selecting genes in MCR that is based on a flexible mixture model for the marginal distribution of a modified F-statistic.

However, some patients show a low response to GC treatment. We hypothesized that proteins that correlated to discrimination between symptomatic high and low responders (HR and LR) to GC treatment might be regulated by GCs and therefore suitable as biomarkers for GC treatment. Methodology/Principal Findings: We identified 953 nasal fluid proteins in symptomatic HR and LR with a LC MS/MS basedquantitative proteomics analysis and performed multivariate analysis to identify a combination of proteins that best separated symptomatic HR and LR. Pathway analysis showed that those proteins were most enriched in the acute phase response pathway. We prioritized candidate biomarkers for GC treatment based on the multivariate and pathway analysis. Next, we tested if those candidate biomarkers differed before and after GC treatment in nasal fluids from 40 patients with SAR using ELISA. Several proteins including ORM (P,0.0001), APOH (P,0.0001), FGA (P,0.01), CTSD (P,0.05) and SERPINB3 (P,0.05) differed significantly before and after GC treatment. Particularly, ORM (P,0.01), FGA (P,0.05) and APOH (P,0.01) that belonged to the acute phase response pathway decreased significantly in HR but not LR before and after GC treatment. Conclusions/Significance: We identified several novel biomarkers for GC treatment response in SAR with combined proteomics, multivariate and pathway analysis.

This approach, though, has faults, and we point out a few. A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses -the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferronitype procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples."},{"id":2063978378,"microsoftAcademicId":2063978378,"doi":"10.1214/009053604000000067","title":"Least angle regression","authors":[{"LN":"Efron","FN":"Bradley","affil":"Stanford University"},{"LN":"Hastie","FN":"Trevor","affil":"Stanford University"},{"LN":"Johnstone","FN":"Iain","affil":"Stanford University"},{"LN":"Tibshirani","FN":"Robert","affil":"Stanford University"},{"LN":"Ishwaran","FN":"Hemant","affil":"Cleveland Clinic"},{"LN":"Knight","FN":"Keith","affil":"University of Toronto"},{"LN":"Loubes","FN":"Jean Michel","affil":"University of Paris-Sud"},{"LN":"Loubes","FN":"Jean Michel","affil":"Centre national de la recherche scientifique"},{"LN":"Massart","FN":"Pascal","affil":"University of Paris-Sud"},{"LN":"Massart","FN":"Pascal","affil":"Université Paris-Saclay"},{"LN":"Madigan","FN":"David","affil":"Rutgers University"},{"LN":"Ridgeway","FN":"Greg","affil":"Rutgers University"},{"LN":"Ridgeway","FN":"Greg","affil":"RAND Corporation"},{"LN":"Rosset","FN":"Saharon","affil":"Stanford University"},{"LN":"Rosset","FN":"Saharon","affil":"IBM"},{"LN":"Zhu","FN":"J.

Typically we have available a large collection of possible covariates from which we hope to select a parsimonious set for the efficient prediction of a response variable. Least Angle Regression (LARS), a new model selection algorithm, is a useful and less greedy version of traditional forward selection methods. Three main properties are derived: (1) A simple modification of the LARS algorithm implements the Lasso, an attractive version of ordinary least squares that constrains the sum of the absolute regression coefficients; the LARS modification calculates all possible Lasso estimates for a given problem, using an order of magnitude less computer time than previous methods. (2) A different LARS modification efficiently implements Forward Stagewise linear regression, another promising new model selection method; this connection explains the similar numerical results previously observed for the Lasso and Stagewise, and helps us understand the properties of both methods, which are seen as constrained versions of the simpler LARS algorithm. (3) A simple approximation for the degrees of freedom of a LARS estimate is available, from which we derive a Cp estimate of prediction error; this allows a principled choice among the range of possible LARS estimates. LARS and its variants are computationally efficient: the paper describes a publicly available algorithm that requires only the same order of magnitude of computational effort as ordinary least squares applied to the full set of covariates."},{"id":171292237,"microsoftAcademicId":171292237,"title":"APPROACHES FOR BAYESIAN VARIABLE SELECTION","authors":[{"LN":"George","FN":"Edward I.","affil":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"LN":"McCulloch","FN":"Robert E.","affil":"University of Chicago"}],"year":1997,"journal":"Statistica Sinica","references":[2106706098,2108207895,18967634,2007069447,2017899835,71542459,133977063,1628017834,1582801283,2048971218,2330192890,2162898443,2328893411,2166624680,140571646,103841382,1999974018,2001414552,1604468148,2033149996,2168832308,1978160697,1973288683,1572250146,2122891730,1977716274,2115066119,1984113331,2240502810],"citationsCount":1212,"citationContext":{"18967634":["This can be done quickly and efficiently by using the Cholesky decomposition (see Thisted (1988))."],"103841382":["Some of the papers which propose procedures related to those discussed here include Carlin and Chib (1995), Chipman (1995), Clyde and Parmigiani (1994), Clyde, DeSimone, and Parmigiani (1996), George and Mc-Culloch (1993, 1995), George, McCulloch and Tsay (1995), Geweke (1996), Hoeting, Raftery and Madigan (1995), Kuo and Mallick (1994), Meehan, Dempster and Brown (1994), Mitchell and Beauchamp (1988),  Phillips and Smith (1995) , Raftery, ..."],"140571646":["Some of the papers which propose procedures related to those discussed here include Carlin and Chib (1995), Chipman (1995), Clyde and Parmigiani (1994), Clyde, DeSimone, and Parmigiani (1996), George and Mc-Culloch (1993, 1995), George, McCulloch and Tsay (1995), Geweke (1996), Hoeting, Raftery and Madigan (1995),  Kuo and Mallick (1994) , Meehan, Dempster and Brown (1994), Mitchell and Beauchamp (1988), Phillips and Smith (1995), Raftery, ..."],"1572250146":["When condition (30) holds, Smith and Kohn (1996) observed that fast updating of g(γ) can be obtained as follows."],"1582801283":["Some of the papers which propose procedures related to those discussed here include  Carlin and Chib (1995) , Chipman (1995), Clyde and Parmigiani (1994), Clyde, DeSimone, and Parmigiani (1996), George and Mc-Culloch (1993, 1995), George, McCulloch and Tsay (1995), Geweke (1996), Hoeting, Raftery and Madigan (1995), Kuo and Mallick (1994), Meehan, Dempster and Brown (1994), Mitchell and Beauchamp (1988), Phillips and Smith (1995), Raftery, ...\u001b Carlin and Chib (1995) , Green (1995) and Phillips and Smith (1996) have proposed alternative, computationally intensive MCMC methods which may also be used to simulate (11) for the case υ0γ(i) =0 ."],"1604468148":["which requires recomputing (X � X +σ2(DγRγDγ)−1)−1 on the basis of new values of σ2 and γ.

A dense set of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) covering the genome and an efficient method to assess SNP genotypes are expected to be available in the near future. An outstanding question is how to use these technologies efficiently to identify genes affecting liability to complex disorders. To achieve this goal, we propose a statistical method that has several optimal properties: It can be used with case-control data and yet, like family-based designs, controls for population heterogeneity; it is insensitive to the usual violations of model assumptions, such as cases failing to be strictly independent; and, by using Bayesian outlier methods, it circumvents the need for Bonferroni correction for multiple tests, leading to better performance in many settings while still constraining risk for false positives. The performance of our genomic control method is quite good for plausible effects of liability genes, which bodes well for future genetic analyses of complex disorders."},{"id":2007069447,"microsoftAcademicId":2007069447,"doi":"10.1080/01621459.1993.10476353","title":"Variable Selection via Gibbs Sampling","authors":[{"LN":"George","FN":"Edward I.","affil":"University of Texas at Austin"},{"LN":"McCulloch","FN":"Robert E.","affil":"University of Chicago"}],"year":1993,"journal":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","references":[2083875149,2163738067,2319794630,2064142190,1969423031,2152977846,2022480405,2111051773,2046811824,130037070,1999974018,2072825397,110902330,150276701,2054699810,2493170222,2030689745,2037055640,1559758217,2317114729,2312977807],"citationsCount":2603,"citationContext":{"1969423031":["Miller (1990) provided a comprehensive summary and bibliography of these procedures."],"2046811824":["Some of the work related to our approach includes Lempers (1971), Atkinson (1978), Perrichi (1984), Smith and Spiegelhalter (1980), Spiegelhalter and Smith (1982), Zellner (1984), Poirier (1985), Stewart (1987), and especially Mitchell and Beauchamp (1988)."],"2163738067":["The second line of background research concerns Gibbs sampling; see Casella and George (1992) for an elementary introduction."]},"abstract":"Abstract A crucial problem in building a multiple regression model is the selection of predictors to include. The main thrust of this article is to propose and develop a procedure that uses probabilistic considerations for selecting promising subsets. This procedure entails embedding the regression setup in a hierarchical normal mixture model where latent variables are used to identify subset choices. In this framework the promising subsets of predictors can be identified as those with higher posterior probability. The computational burden is then alleviated by using the Gibbs sampler to indirectly sample from this multinomial posterior distribution on the set of possible subset choices. Those subsets with higher probability—the promising ones—can then be identified by their more frequent appearance in the Gibbs sample."},{"id":2217809488,"microsoftAcademicId":2217809488,"doi":"10.1038/nature04226","title":"A haplotype map of the human genome","authors":[{"LN":"Belmont","FN":"John W.","affil":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"LN":"Boudreau","FN":"Andrew"},{"LN":"Leal","FN":"Suzanne M.","affil":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"LN":"Hardenbol","FN":"Paul"},{"LN":"Pasternak","FN":"Shiran","affil":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"LN":"Wheeler","FN":"David A.","affil":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"LN":"Willis","FN":"Thomas D."},{"LN":"Yu","FN":"Fuli","affil":"Baylor College of Medicine"},{"LN":"Yang","FN":"Huanming","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Gao","FN":"Yang","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Hu","FN":"Haoran","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Hu","FN":"Weitao","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Li","FN":"Chaohua","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Lin","FN":"Wei","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Liu","FN":"Siqi","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Pan","FN":"Hao","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Tang","FN":"Xiaoli","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Jian","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Wei","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Yu","FN":"Jun","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Zhang","FN":"Bo","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Zhang","FN":"Qingrun","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Zhao","FN":"Hongbin","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Zhou","FN":"Jun","affil":"Chinese Academy of Sciences"},{"LN":"Barry","FN":"Rachel","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Blumenstiel","FN":"Brendan","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Camargo","FN":"Amy","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Defelice","FN":"Matthew","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Faggart","FN":"Maura","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Goyette","FN":"Mary","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Gupta","FN":"Supriya","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Moore","FN":"Jamie","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Nguyen","FN":"Huy","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Parkin","FN":"Melissa","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Roy","FN":"Jessica","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Stahl","FN":"Erich","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Winchester","FN":"Ellen","affil":"Broad Institute"},{"LN":"Altshuler","FN":"David","affil":"Harvard University"},{"LN":"Shen","FN":"Yan","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Yao","FN":"Zhijian","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Huang","FN":"Wei","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Chu","FN":"Xun","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"He","FN":"Yungang","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Jin","FN":"Li","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Liu","FN":"Yangfan","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Shen","FN":"Yayun","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Sun","FN":"Weiwei","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Haifeng","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Yi","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Ying","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Xiong","FN":"Xiaoyan","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Xu","FN":"Liang","affil":"Chinese National Human Genome Center"},{"LN":"Waye","FN":"Mary M.Y.","affil":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"LN":"Tsui","FN":"Stephen K.W.","affil":"The Chinese University of Hong Kong"},{"LN":"Xue","FN":"Hong","affil":"Hong Kong University of Science and Technology"},{"LN":"Wong","FN":"J.

Applications of our method include demonstrating the presence of population structure, assigning individuals to populations, studying hybrid zones, and identifying migrants and admixed individuals. We show that the method can produce highly accurate assignments using modest numbers of loci— e.g. , seven microsatellite loci in an example using genotype data from an endangered bird species.

A typical microarray experiment can produce millions of data points, raising serious problems of data reduction, and simultaneous inference. We consider one such experiment in which oligonucleotide arrays were employed to assess the genetic effects of ionizing radiation on seven thousand human genes. A simple nonparametric empirical Bayes model is introduced, which is used to guide the efficient reduction of the data to a single summary statistic per gene, and also to make simultaneous inferences concerning which genes were affected by the radiation. Although our focus is on one specific experiment, the proposed methods can be applied quite generally. The empirical Bayes inferences are closely related to the frequentist false discovery rate (FDR) criterion."},{"id":2042810309,"microsoftAcademicId":2042810309,"doi":"10.1016/s0169-7439(98)00109-9","title":"Orthogonal signal correction of near-infrared spectra","authors":[{"LN":"Wold","FN":"Svante","affil":"Umeå University"},{"LN":"Antti","FN":"Henrik","affil":"Umeå University"},{"LN":"Lindgren","FN":"Fredrik","affil":"Astra"},{"LN":"Öhman","FN":"Jerker","affil":"Umeå University"}],"year":1998,"journal":"Chemometrics and Intelligent Laboratory Systems","references":[2063060349,2016090370,1966089218,2045125597,2080653934,2020315430,2163040853,2102667102,1967831846,2008674192],"citationsCount":1125,"abstract":"Near-infrared (NIR) spectra are often pre-processed in order to remove systematic noise such as base-line variation and multiplicative scatter effects. This is done by differentiating the spectra to first or second derivatives, by multiplicative signal correction (MSC), or by similar mathematical filtering methods. This pre-processing may, however, also remove information from the spectra regarding Y (the measured response variable in multivariate calibration applications). We here show how a variant of PLS can be used to achieve a signal correction that is as close to orthogonal as possible to a given Y-vector or Y-matrix. Thus, one ensures that the signal correction removes as little information as possible regarding Y. In the case when the number of X-variables (K) exceeds the number of observations (N), strict orthogonality is obtained. The approach is called orthogonal signal correction (OSC) and is here applied to four different data sets of multivariate calibration. The results are compared with those of traditional signal correction as well as with those of no pre-processing, and OSC is shown to give substantial improvements.

climate history is often understood by breaking it down into constituent climatic epochs1. Over the Common Era (the past 2,000 years) these epochs, such as the Little Ice Age2–4, have been characterized as having occurred at the same time across extensive spatial scales5. Although the rapid global warming seen in observations over the past 150 years does show nearly global coherence6, the spatiotemporal coherence of climate epochs earlier in the Common Era has yet to be robustly tested. Here we use global palaeoclimate reconstructions for the past 2,000 years, and find no evidence for preindustrial globally coherent cold and warm epochs. In particular, we find that the coldest epoch of the last millennium—the putative Little Ice Age—is most likely to have experienced the coldest temperatures during the fifteenth century in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, during the seventeenth century in northwestern Europe and southeastern North America, and during the mid-nineteenth century over most of the remaining regions. Furthermore, the spatial coherence that does exist over the preindustrial Common Era is consistent with the spatial coherence of stochastic climatic variability. This lack of spatiotemporal coherence indicates that preindustrial forcing was not sufficient to produce globally synchronous extreme temperatures at multidecadal and centennial timescales. By contrast, we find that the warmest period of the past two millennia occurred during the twentieth century for more than 98 per cent of the globe. This provides strong evidence that anthropogenic global warming is not only unparalleled in terms of absolute temperatures5, but also unprecedented in spatial consistency within the context of the past 2,000 years."},"input":[{"id":2151746416,"microsoftAcademicId":2151746416,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.0805721105","title":"Proxy-based reconstructions of hemispheric and global surface temperature variations over the past two millennia","authors":[{"LN":"Mann","FN":"Michael E.","affil":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"LN":"Zhang","FN":"Zhihua","affil":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"LN":"Hughes","FN":"Malcolm K.","affil":"Tree-Ring Research, Laboratory of"},{"LN":"Bradley","FN":"Raymond S.","affil":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"LN":"Miller","FN":"Sonya K.","affil":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"LN":"Rutherford","FN":"Scott","affil":"Roger Williams University"},{"LN":"Ni","FN":"Fenbiao","affil":"University of Arizona"}],"year":2008,"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","references":[2939474406,1979440117,2070257026,1660201747,2131532072,2103095238,2054167751,2027745714,2011526969,2146079950,2126147651,2176233088,2042859974,2074964089,2174160981,1965358009,1978887368,2340356055,1993341938,1978291154,1907038160,2062457444,2148200724,2007377949,2043831111,2003326514,2916771639,2008693787,2169277953,1994800218,2077617098,1582709791,2056453952,2019728218,2098654378,2139223514,2142967805,1577685107,2056557542,2064908013,1989058095,2111874475],"citationsCount":1073,"abstract":"Following the suggestions of a recent National Research Council report [NRC (National Research Council) (2006) Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years (Natl Acad Press, Washington, DC).], we reconstruct surface temperature at hemispheric and global scale for much of the last 2,000 years using a greatly expanded set of proxy data for decadal-to-centennial climate changes, recently updated instrumental data, and complementary methods that have been thoroughly tested and validated with model simulation experiments. Our results extend previous conclusions that recent Northern Hemisphere surface temperature increases are likely anomalous in a long-term context. Recent warmth appears anomalous for at least the past 1,300 years whether or not tree-ring data are used. If tree-ring data are used, the conclusion can be extended to at least the past 1,700 years, but with additional strong caveats. The reconstructed amplitude of change over past centuries is greater than hitherto reported, with somewhat greater Medieval warmth in the Northern Hemisphere, albeit still not reaching recent levels."},{"id":2142987884,"microsoftAcademicId":2142987884,"doi":"10.1126/science.1096109","title":"Reconstructing past climate from noisy data","authors":[{"LN":"Storch","FN":"Hans von","affil":"Institute for Coastal Research, GKSS Research Centre, Geesthacht 21502, Germany."},{"LN":"Zorita","FN":"Eduardo","affil":"Institute for Coastal Research, GKSS Research Centre, Geesthacht 21502, Germany."},{"LN":"Jones","FN":"Julie M.","affil":"Institute for Coastal Research, GKSS Research Centre, Geesthacht 21502, Germany."},{"LN":"Dimitriev","FN":"Yegor","affil":"Institute for Coastal Research, GKSS Research Centre, Geesthacht 21502, Germany."},{"LN":"González-Rouco","FN":"Fidel","affil":"Complutense University of Madrid"},{"LN":"Tett","FN":"Simon F.

The review is in three parts: the principal high-resolution proxy disciplines (trees, corals, ice cores and documentary evidence), emphasizing current issues in their use for climate reconstruction; the various approaches that have been adopted to combine multiple climate proxy records to provide estimates of past annual-to-decadal timescale Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures and other climate variables, such as large-scale circulation indices; and the forcing histories used in climate model simulations of the past millennium. We discuss the need to develop a framework through which current and new approaches to interpreting these proxy data may be rigorously assessed using pseudo-proxies derived from climate model runs, where the `answer' is known. The article concludes with a list of recommendations. First, more raw proxy data are required from the diverse disciplines and from more locations, as well as replication, for all proxy sources, of the basic raw measurements to improve absolute dating, and to better distinguish the proxy climate signal from noise. Second, more effort is required to improve the understanding of what individual proxies respond to, supported by more site measurements and process studies. These activities should also be mindful of the correlation structure of instrumental data, indicating which adjacent proxy records ought to be in agreement and which not. Third, large-scale climate reconstructions should be attempted using a wide variety of techniques, emphasizing those for which quantified errors can be estimated at specified timescales. Fourth, a greater use of climate model simulations is needed to guide the choice of reconstruction techniques (the pseudo-proxy concept) and possibly help determine where, given limited resources, future sampling should be concentrated."},{"id":2108531121,"microsoftAcademicId":2108531121,"doi":"10.1126/science.1177303","title":"Global Signatures and Dynamical Origins of the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly","authors":[{"LN":"Mann","FN":"Michael E.","affil":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"LN":"Zhang","FN":"Zhihua","affil":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"LN":"Rutherford","FN":"Scott","affil":"Roger Williams University"},{"LN":"Bradley","FN":"Raymond S.","affil":"University of Massachusetts Amherst"},{"LN":"Hughes","FN":"Malcolm K.","affil":"University of Arizona"},{"LN":"Shindell","FN":"Drew","affil":"Goddard Institute for Space Studies"},{"LN":"Ammann","FN":"Caspar","affil":"National Center for Atmospheric Research"},{"LN":"Faluvegi","FN":"Greg","affil":"Goddard Institute for Space Studies"},{"LN":"Ni","FN":"Fenbiao","affil":"University of Arizona"}],"year":2009,"journal":"Science","references":[2939474406,2907110490,1979440117,2093401535,2070257026,1660201747,2131532072,2151746416,2011526969,2146079950,2034795620,2038669354,1978887368,1993341938,1982725147,1907038160,2070398649,2097872776,2012516451,2043831111,2003326514,2175816372,2169074850,2141077951,2173880861,1999037513,2161680946,1965018909,2139223514],"citationsCount":1576,"abstract":"Global temperatures are known to have varied over the past 1500 years, but the spatial patterns have remained poorly defined.

global climate changes had strong regional expression. To elucidate their spatio-temporal pattern, we reconstructed past temperatures for seven continental-scale regions during the past one to two millennia. The most coherent feature in nearly all of the regional temperature reconstructions is a long-term cooling trend, which ended late in the nineteenth century. At multi-decadal to centennial scales, temperature variability shows distinctly different regional patterns, with more similarity within each hemisphere than between them. There were no globally synchronous multi-decadal warm or cold intervals that define a worldwide Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age, but all reconstructions show generally cold conditions between ad 1580 and 1880, punctuated in some regions by warm decades during the eighteenth century. The transition to these colder conditions occurred earlier in the Arctic, Europe and Asia than in North America or the Southern Hemisphere regions. Recent warming reversed the long-term cooling; during the period ad 1971–2000, the area-weighted average reconstructed temperature was higher than any other time in nearly 1,400 years."},{"id":2105942117,"microsoftAcademicId":2105942117,"doi":"10.1002/joc.3370140404","title":"SPATIAL REGRESSION METHODS IN DENDROCLIMATOLOGY: A REVIEW AND COMPARISON OF TWO TECHNIQUES","authors":[{"LN":"Cook","FN":"Edward R.","affil":"Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory"},{"LN":"Briffa","FN":"Keith R.","affil":"University of East Anglia"},{"LN":"Jones","FN":"Philip D.","affil":"University of East Anglia"}],"year":1994,"journal":"International Journal of Climatology","references":[2064142190,1993196883,2033904036,1981256179,1529972356,1981381864,1989872308,2160172778,1577685107,2085655266,2075007695,2085297375,1995862475,1982864447,2023151740,2174577859,2014185544,1656882770,2029670837,1993424561,2071258578,2444456673,2087702973,2000432226,2088494568,2333941540,181764242,40849163,1983616018,198971112,2915112861,2153412629,2149323977,2107836296,2037414600,2079453955,2174400750,40820063,2080331419,2144571184,2052036660,2026202948,2203908052,2007787896,2005876726],"citationsCount":471,"abstract":"We review and compare two alternative spatial regression methods used in dendroclimatology to reconstruct climate from tree rings. These methods are orthogonal spatial regression (OSR) and canonical regression (CR). Both the OSR and CR methods have a common foundation in least-squares theory and converge to the same solution when all p candidate tree-ring predictors of climate are forced into the model. However, the perfomance of OSR and CR may differ when only subsets p' < p predictors are used. Theory cannot predict how either method is likely to perform when best-subset selection is applied, especially with regards to reconstruction accuracy. Consequently, empirical comparisons of OSR and CR are made using three tree-ring and climate networks from western Europe and eastern North America that have been used in previous dendroclimatic studies. These comparisons rely on a suite of regression model verification statistics to validate the accuracy of the climatic reconstructions produced by the best-subset models. The results indicate little real difference between OSR and CR, with each performing equally good or bad depending on the amount of recoverable climatic information in the tree rings. Canonical regression may perform slightly better in high signal-to-noise cases; conversely, OSR may perform slightly better when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. None of these apparent differences are large enough to select one method in preference to the other, however, and many more comparisons would be needed to determine if such indications are generally valid."},{"id":2070257026,"microsoftAcademicId":2070257026,"doi":"10.1126/science.1093877","title":"European Seasonal and Annual Temperature Variability, Trends, and Extremes Since 1500","authors":[{"LN":"Luterbacher","FN":"Jürg","affil":"University of Bern"},{"LN":"Dietrich","FN":"Daniel","affil":"University of Bern"},{"LN":"Xoplaki","FN":"Elena","affil":"University of Bern"},{"LN":"Grosjean","FN":"Martin","affil":"University of Bern"},{"LN":"Wanner","FN":"Heinz"}],"year":2004,"journal":"Science","references":[2166163519,2008668438,1978601068,2133488074,1660201747,2131532072,2130256070,2027745714,2029688250,2041875607,2014236192,2122809335,2074964089,1978887368,1963650928,1993341938,2043514774,2115183951,2148200724,2007377949,2146937853,2181097193,1898890511,2175805510,2105942117,2173880861,2141729885,1618184752,1537214629,1496733290,2014944844,220666396,2064908013,2056622109,2075377641,2612714301,19410568,2043474973,125086599],"citationsCount":1679,"citationContext":{"1537214629":["Station/Region Latitude Longitude Years Missing Sources Germany Southern 1500–1658 None ( 1 ) Switzerland Swiss Plateau 1500–1658 None (2,3)\u001b( 1 ) R.

Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades..."},{"id":2050413070,"microsoftAcademicId":2050413070,"doi":"10.1007/s10584-007-9276-x","title":"The importance of the geophysical context in statistical evaluations of climate reconstruction procedures","authors":[{"LN":"Ammann","FN":"Caspar M.","affil":"National Center for Atmospheric Research"},{"LN":"Wahl","FN":"Eugene R.","affil":"Alfred University"}],"year":2007,"journal":"Climatic Change","references":[2939474406,1522296012,2070257026,1660201747,2131532072,2130256070,2103095238,2054167751,2103651007,2151571592,2174160981,2038669354,1978887368,2111948917,2142987884,2136350156,1982725147,2171612194,2180677008,2097872776,2123539718,2012516451,1996896637,2122112067,2176588269,2060208241,1968257597,2043831111,1974992986,2003326514,2916771639,2335780408,2061607134,2181097193,2169074850,2008693787,2164897769,2059738590,2127582060,2058641882,1989061310,1994800218,2119406349,2161917327,2149828401,2070092732,2111485892,2098654378,2026603628,2139223514,2142967805,2066165799,74243001,2180301600,2025336675,1548329103,2107602834,1977178596,200810345,1989997544,2796307220,1984232315,2141430304,2099285484,1987484552,1640223595,98755047],"citationsCount":101,"citationContext":{"98755047":["These climate field reconstructions (CFRs) not only provide information over regions where direct proxy data are available, but they can make use of the fact that the climate system anomalies can be projected onto a relatively small set of principal modes of variability (Kaplan et al. 1997; Mann et al. 1998; Corti et al. 1999;  Palmer 1999;  Stephenson et al. 2004)."],"200810345":["In this process, it will be important to further refine the reconstructions and to resolve seasonal rather than only annual variations (Mann et al. 2000; Luterbacher et al. 2004; Xoplaki et al. 2005), and as the data density increases one can even approach expansion to non-","This advantage has proven particularly interesting for the study of variations in some of the climate modes with global significance, such as ENSO (Mann et al. 2000) or the NAO (Cook et al."],"1660201747":["comparison results reported by Mann et al.

Here, we reflect on what can be learned from recent scientific exchanges and identify important challenges that remain to be addressed openly and productively by the community. One challenge arises from the real, underlying trend in temperatures during the instrumental period. This trend can affect regression-based reconstruction performance in cases where the calibration period does not appropriately cover the range of conditions encountered during the reconstruction. However, because it is tied to a unique spatial pattern driven by change in radiative balance, the trend cannot simply be removed in the method of climate field reconstruction used by MBH on the statistical argument of preserving degrees of freedom.

Recent instrumental data have shown a remarkable degree of asynchronicity between Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere temperature fluctuations, thereby questioning the relative importance of internal versus external drivers of past as well as future climate variability1, 2, 3. However, large-scale temperature reconstructions for the past millennium have focused on the Northern Hemisphere4, 5, limiting empirical assessments of inter-hemispheric variability on multi-decadal to centennial timescales. Here, we introduce a new millennial ensemble reconstruction of annually resolved temperature variations for the Southern Hemisphere based on an unprecedented network of terrestrial and oceanic palaeoclimate proxy records. In conjunction with an independent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction ensemble5, this record reveals an extended cold period (1594–1677) in both hemispheres but no globally coherent warm phase during the pre-industrial (1000–1850) era. The current (post-1974) warm phase is the only period of the past millennium where both hemispheres are likely to have experienced contemporaneous warm extremes. Our analysis of inter-hemispheric temperature variability in an ensemble of climate model simulations for the past millennium suggests that models tend to overemphasize Northern Hemisphere–Southern Hemisphere synchronicity by underestimating the role of internal ocean–atmosphere dynamics, particularly in the ocean-dominated Southern Hemisphere. Our results imply that climate system predictability on decadal to century timescales may be lower than expected based on assessments of external climate forcing and Northern Hemisphere temperature variations5, 6 alone."},{"id":1964772454,"microsoftAcademicId":1964772454,"doi":"10.1175/2010jcli3328.1","title":"A Pseudoproxy Evaluation of the CCA and RegEM Methods for Reconstructing Climate Fields of the Last Millennium","authors":[{"LN":"Smerdon","FN":"Jason E."},{"LN":"Kaplan","FN":"Alexey"},{"LN":"Chang","FN":"Diana"},{"LN":"Evans","FN":"Michael N."}],"year":2010,"journal":"Journal of Climate","references":[2096809505,2070257026,1660201747,2131532072,2108531121,2054167751,2151746416,2027745714,2146079950,2067409327,2074964089,2174160981,1967722715,1978887368,2142987884,2123564268,2043514774,1978291154,1982725147,2062457444,1996896637,2060208241,2043831111,1974992986,1996250618,2003326514,2146937853,2335780408,2100055302,1898890511,2059738590,2141077951,2169277953,2105942117,2048485366,2024054778,2135462719,2174817738,1994800218,2077617098,1520479453,2056393075,2088151138,1658326591,2066850544,1582709791,2023189905,2139223514,2142967805,2050413070,2074767856,2066165799,2137101078,2102160239,2089439943,2025336675,1966499954,2115965836,2034751473,2107602834,2056557542,2064908013,2043573028,2037660574,1989997544,2020485766,1984232315,2141430304,2065128000,2150259853,2029670837,1980641310,2015065872,2111874475,2001786727,2134270795,2170349739,2065268105,1987484552,2626598704,2091142565,2058236338],"citationsCount":79,"abstract":"Abstract Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is evaluated for paleoclimate field reconstructions in the context of pseudoproxy experiments assembled from the millennial integration (850–1999 c.e.) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model, version 1.4.

Since instrumental measurements are generally only available after 1850, temperature fields must be reconstructed using paleoclimate archives, known as proxies. Various climate field reconstructions (CFR) methods have been proposed to relate past temperature to such proxy networks. In this work, we propose a new CFR method, called GraphEM, based on Gaussian Markov random fields embedded within an EM algorithm. Gaussian Markov random fields provide a natural and flexible framework for modeling high-dimensional spatial fields. At the same time, they provide the parameter reduction necessary for obtaining precise and well-conditioned estimates of the covariance structure, even in the sample-starved setting common in paleoclimate applications. In this paper, we propose and compare the performance of different methods to estimate the graphical structure of climate fields, and demonstrate how the GraphEM algorithm can be used to reconstruct past climate variations. The performance of GraphEM is compared to the widely used CFR method RegEM with regularization via truncated total least squares, using synthetic data. Our results show that GraphEM can yield significant improvements, with uniform gains over space, and far better risk properties. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of temperature fields can be well estimated by graphs where each neighbor is only connected to a few geographically close neighbors, and that the increase in performance is directly related to recovering the underlying sparsity in the covariance of the spatial field. Our work demonstrates how significant improvements can be made in climate reconstruction methods by better modeling the covariance structure of the climate field."},{"id":2121273076,"microsoftAcademicId":2121273076,"doi":"10.1016/0031-0182(65)90004-0","title":"The early medieval warm epoch and its sequel","authors":[{"LN":"Lamb","FN":"H.H.","affil":"Met Office"}],"year":1965,"journal":"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology","references":[2546433280,2089867014,2768052203,2331730236,2106316021,2126068044,2323737622,2142069364,618498512,2082172276,1969644302,2774406008,1964172757,2319673303,654802435,2581917113,51536656],"citationsCount":735,"abstract":"Abstract<br><br> Evidence has been accumulating in many fields of investigation pointing to a notably warm climate in many parts of the world, that lasted a few centuries around A.D. 1000–1200, and was followed by a decline of temperature levels till between 1500 and 1700 the coldest phase since the last ice age occurred.

The mid-latitude atmospheric circulation is the dominant factor for regional changes in temperature, rainfall, and other climatic variables. Here we present reconstructions of gridded monthly sea level pressure (SLP) fields back to 1659 and seasonal reconstructions from 1500-1658 for the eastern North Atlantic-European region (30°W to 40°E; 30°N to 70°N). These were developed using principal component regression analysis based on the combination of early instrumental station series (pressure, temperature and precipitation) and documentary proxy data from Eurasian sites. The relationships were derived over the 1901-1960 calibration period and verified over 1961-1990. Under the assumption of stationarity in the statistical relationships, a transfer function derived over the 1901-1990 period was used to reconstruct the 500-year large-scale SLP fields. Systematic quality testing indicated reliable winter reconstructions throughout the entire period. Lower skill was obtained for the other seasons, although meaningful monthly reconstructions were available from around 1700 onwards, when station pressure series became available. The quality and the reconstructed SLP fields for two exceptionally cold years (1573, 1740) are discussed and climatologically interpreted. An EOF analysis of the 1500-1999 winter SLP revealed, firstly, a zonal flow pattern with pronounced decadal to centenial time scale variations, secondly, a monopole pattern over northwest Europe and thirdly, a pattern modulating the meridional flow component over Europe. These 500-year SLP reconstructions should be useful for modelling studies, particulary for analyses of low-frequency atmospheric variability and for circulation dynamics."},{"id":1992866464,"microsoftAcademicId":1992866464,"doi":"10.1038/nature08769","title":"Ensemble reconstruction constraints on the global carbon cycle sensitivity to climate","authors":[{"LN":"Frank","FN":"David C.","affil":"External Organizations"},{"LN":"Esper","FN":"Jan","affil":"University of Mainz"},{"LN":"Raible","FN":"Christoph C.","affil":"University of Bern"},{"LN":"Raible","FN":"Christoph C.","affil":"Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research"},{"LN":"Büntgen","FN":"Ulf","affil":"Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, Zürcherstrasse 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland ,"},{"LN":"Trouet","FN":"Valerie M","affil":"Swiss Federal Research Institute WSL, Zürcherstrasse 111, CH-8903 Birmensdorf, Switzerland ,"},{"LN":"Stocker","FN":"Benjamin","affil":"University of Bern"},{"LN":"Stocker","FN":"Benjamin","affil":"Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research"},{"LN":"Joos","FN":"Fortunat","affil":"University of Bern"},{"LN":"Joos","FN":"Fortunat","affil":"Oeschger Centre for Climate Change Research"}],"year":2010,"journal":"Nature","references":[2939474406,1979440117,2151328940,2160252043,2165037481,2131532072,2054167751,2151746416,2027745714,1965122835,2034795620,2042859974,2074964089,1965358009,2108379304,2142987884,2043514774,1994973226,2129992710,1797264839,2115977576,2062457444,2133306450,2062778690,1974992986,1954525867,2104833230,1969688566,2123450273,1499364211,1989401502,2060095387,2024054778,2091101199,1618184752,2159103614,2077617098,2145796050,2129809782,1497261301,2187518561,2098654378,1511169134,2150621247,2018541493,2152659511,2795447339],"citationsCount":264,"abstract":"Climate warming tends to cause a net release of CO2, which in turn causes an amplification of warming. Estimates of the magnitude of this effect vary widely, leading to a wide range in global warming projections. Recent work suggested that the magnitude of this positive feedback might be about 40 parts per million by volume of CO2 per °C of warming. David Frank and colleagues use three Antarctic ice cores and a suite of climate reconstructions to show that the feedback is likely to be much smaller, with a median of only about 8 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C. Anthropogenic global warming is likely to be amplified by positive feedback from the global carbon cycle; however, the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle, and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate. By combining a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, this climate sensitivity is now shown to be much smaller than previously thought. The processes controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive1,2,3,4 and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming3. Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20–100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations1,5,6,7, warming of the climate system causes a net release of CO2 into the atmosphere; this in turn amplifies warming. But the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle (termed γ), and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate, giving rise to large uncertainties in global warming projections8,9. Here we quantify the median γ as 7.7 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C warming, with a likely range of 1.7–21.4 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for γ on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of >200,000 members, quantification of γ is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of γ calculated from any of ten coupled carbon–climate models, we find that γ is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. Our results are incompatibly lower (P < 0.05) than recent pre-industrial empirical estimates of ∼40 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C (refs 6, 7), and correspondingly suggest ∼80% less potential amplification of ongoing global warming."},{"id":1984983544,"microsoftAcademicId":1984983544,"doi":"10.1175/jcli-d-11-00326.1","title":"Last Millennium Climate and Its Variability in CCSM4","authors":[{"LN":"Landrum","FN":"Laura"},{"LN":"Otto-Bliesner","FN":"Bette L."},{"LN":"Wahl","FN":"Eugene R."},{"LN":"Conley","FN":"Andrew"},{"LN":"Lawrence","FN":"Peter J."},{"LN":"Rosenbloom","FN":"Nan"},{"LN":"Teng","FN":"Haiyan"}],"year":2013,"journal":"Journal of Climate","references":[2093401535,2020297738,1985217958,2106963750,2083070320,2120115499,1660201747,2130256070,2158521569,2108531121,2010530988,2054167751,2124757012,2027745714,2122046874,2011526969,2165937826,2131462802,2126147651,2034795620,2128628033,2123559861,2040763894,2170086526,2042859974,2074964089,2038669354,1985370915,1967031773,2017818081,2123564268,2043514774,2034434715,2048792237,1606803730,1982725147,2106548167,1907038160,2052843944,2081342300,2117917479,2019140816,2062457444,2028776183,2097872776,1970412346,2072084781,2012516451,2048071355,2164907207,2056681173,2026413132,2048968715,2616382558,1968257597,2141117266,2154067776,2003326514,2139892221,2146937853,1977434748,2100438471,2181097193,2169074850,1986637027,2164897769,2141077951,2173880861,2070766630,1678348913,2064133961,2055362524,2135462719,2092958903,2132548519,1523815748,2161917327,2056393075,2027954691,2095817630,2100687909,2102295164,2080136777,2155455495,2081992428,1652201389,2049354824,1965454627,1623772631,2142967805,2103655287,2050413070,2001737915,1700325832,1964189041,2009607087,2072882696,2042356119,2102197928,1978849440,2174461843,2139023992,2038592739,2039353903,2020191406,2115965836,2118636179,2123226885,2015323478,2116061942,2098624257,2121413707,2102033158,1540066974,2008031232,2097296159,1979041041,2098084624],"citationsCount":171,"citationContext":{"1623772631":["• Merged the Pongratz et al.

The CCSM4 LM simulation reproduces many large-scale climate patterns suggested by historical and proxy-data records, with Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) surface temperatures cooling to the early 1800s Common Era by ~0.5°C (NH) and ~0.3°C (SH), followed by warming to the present. High latitudes of both hemispheres show polar amplification of the cooling from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA) associated with sea ice increases. The LM simulation does not reproduce La Nina–like cooling in the eastern Pacific Ocean during the MCA relative to the LIA, as has been suggested by proxy reconstructions. Still, dry medieval conditions over the southwestern and central United States are simulated in agreement with proxy indicators for these regions.

climate reconstructions of the Common Era (1 CE to present) are key to placing industrial-era warming into the context of natural climatic variability. Here we present a community-sourced database of temperature-sensitive proxy records from the PAGES2k initiative. The database gathers 692 records from 648 locations, including all continental regions and major ocean basins. The records are from trees, ice, sediment, corals, speleothems, documentary evidence, and other archives. They range in length from 50 to 2000 years, with a median of 547 years, while temporal resolution ranges from biweekly to centennial. Nearly half of the proxy time series are significantly correlated with HadCRUT4.2 surface temperature over the period 1850–2014. Global temperature composites show a remarkable degree of coherence between high- and low-resolution archives, with broadly similar patterns across archive types, terrestrial versus marine locations, and screening criteria.

In particular, a reconstructed “La Nina-like” pattern during the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age has been widely tied to medieval droughts in southwest North America. This pattern is now used as a key benchmark for global climate model simulations of the last millennium, which have yet to reproduce it. Here we test the pattern's robustness by using four different CFR methods and two proxy networks. With the older network, we find the reconstructed patterns to be highly method-dependent, with the La Nina-like pattern not reproduced by two of the CFR methodologies. With the updated proxy network, a globally uniform MCA emerges with all methods, in agreement with simulations from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 ensemble.

However, the relationship be-tween ice depth and ice age generally cannot be easily es-tablished and requires the combination of numerous investi-gations and/or modelling efforts. This paper presents a new approach to ice core dating based on time–frequency anal-ysis of chemical profiles at a site where seasonal patterns may be significantly distorted by sporadic events of regional importance, specifically at the summit area of Nevado Illi-mani (6350 m a.s.l.), located in the eastern Bolivian Andes (16 37 0 S, 67 46 0 W). We used ion concentration depth pro-files collected along a 100 m deep ice core. The results of Fourier time–frequency and wavelet transforms were first compared. Both methods were applied to a nitrate concentra-tion depth profile. The resulting chronologies were checked by comparison with the multi-proxy year-by-year dating published by de Angelis et al. (2003) and with volcanic tie points. With this first experiment, we demonstrated the effi-ciency of Fourier time–frequency analysis when tracking the nitrate natural variability. In addition, we were able to show spectrum aliasing due to under-sampling below 70 m. In this article, we propose a method of de-aliasing which signifi-cantly improves the core dating in comparison with annual layer manual counting. Fourier time–frequency analysis was applied to concentration depth profiles of seven other ions, providing information on the suitability of each of them for the dating of tropical Andean ice cores."},{"id":2025720061,"microsoftAcademicId":2025720061,"doi":"10.1198/016214506000001437","title":"Strictly Proper Scoring Rules, Prediction, and Estimation","authors":[{"LN":"Gneiting","FN":"Tilmann","affil":"University of Washington"},{"LN":"Raftery","FN":"Adrian E","affil":"University of Washington"}],"year":2007,"journal":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","references":[2057765075,2153529786,2168175751,2040503026,1539462193,1977970167,2027255954,2158840489,2130715829,2170206178,2046649434,1546961578,2079025608,1976255336,2016440615,2118711140,1545465591,2178242555,1590693676,2132558761,2127874106,2174362514,1973744648,179694669,2011292888,2129606454,2180267979,1571413698,1994884074,2180576529,2099756352,2124395162,2156967175,2471967545,1489087445,1999617766,2108871462,2046033161,370143576,199260962,2059078244,2181151222,1969705577,48332454,2109041929,2114119944,2786093300,2145911539,2103574516,2158471180,2027216529,2118713001,1967396577,2122759946,2076204683,2177082044,2060442802,1994331360,1969404663,2029257381,1998274472,2033468335,82989352,1582539699,1969564520,2159463664,2145864490,1522863251,1982575727,1967289526,2155499580,92802620,2081531484,2061509875,2002270895,2088704293,1997647721,2138241424,2175631593,2725275303,2054571746,1984113680,2126163471,2002471330,2094952960,1708211919,2021772914,204889195,1986797382,2034767804,2073241381,1524591749,2109720509,2025792046,2076845236,2172939121,1987103639,2025410634,2025817335,2119929915,1646248817,1555934787,151868691,2155440162,1493831810,124301439,207839918,2123248504,121739997,2001854273,1986055049,2066661957,2904883024,2008709824,2000004528,2085602280,2029552385,383826941,186675064],"citationsCount":2586,"citationContext":{"48332454":["Following Grünwald and Dawid (2004) and Buja et al."],"82989352":["If P belongs to Pβ , then theorem 1 of Székely (2003) implies the equality of the right sides in (22) and (24).","Theorem 1 of Székely (2003) shows that the energy score is strictly proper relative to the class Pβ .","We introduce a generalization of the CRPS that draws on Székely’s (2003) statistical energy perspective."],"92802620":["Gneiting, Raftery, Balabdaoui and Westveld (2003)  contend that the goal of probabilistic forecasting is to maximize sharpness subject to calibration."],"121739997":["Eaton, Giovagnoli, and Sebastiani (1996) used the associated divergence function"],"199260962":["(53) Dawid (1984) showed that Sk,B is asymptotically equivalent to the plug-in maximum likelihood prequential score","Consequently, forecasts should be probabilistic in nature, taking the form of probability distributions over future quantities or events (Dawid 1984).","Dawid (2006) has given details and discussed the generality of the construction.","Following Grünwald and Dawid (2004) and Buja, Stuetzle, and Shen (2005), we call the expected score function","For other examples of scoring rules that depend on μP and P only, see (23) and the right column of table 1 of Dawid and Sebastiani (1999).

Multimodel simulations of the past millennium are used together with a wide range of reconstructions of Northern Hemispheric mean annual temperature to separate climate variability from 850 to 1950 CE into components attributable to external forcing and internal climate variability. External forcing is found to contribute significantly to long-term temperature variations irrespective of the proxy reconstruction, particularly from 1400 onward. Over the MCA alone, however, the effect of forcing is only detectable in about half of the reconstructions considered, and the response to forcing in the models cannot explain the warm conditions around 1000 CE seen in some reconstructions. The residual from the detection analysis is used to estimate internal variability independent from climate modeling, and it is found that the recent observed 50and100-yrhemispheric temperaturetrendsaresubstantiallylargerthananyoftheinternallygeneratedtrends even using the large residuals over the MCA. Variations in solar output and explosive volcanism are found to be the main drivers of climate change from 1400 to 1900, but for the first time a significant contribution from greenhouse gas variations to the cold conditions during 1600‐1800 is also detected. The proxy reconstructions tend to show a smaller forced response than is simulated by the models. This discrepancy is shown, at least partly, to be likely associated with the difference in the response to large volcanic eruptions between reconstructions and model simulations."},{"id":2461294398,"microsoftAcademicId":2461294398,"doi":"10.1002/wcc.418","title":"Reconstructing Earth's surface temperature over the past 2000 years: the science behind the headlines","authors":[{"LN":"Smerdon","FN":"Jason E.","affil":"Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory"},{"LN":"Pollack","FN":"Henry N.","affil":"University of Michigan"}],"year":2016,"journal":"Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change","references":[2024966118,2132555912,2031027346,1660201747,2131532072,2108531121,1974470230,2054167751,2134358106,2151746416,2027745714,2122046874,2011526969,2135496572,2146079950,1971250671,2126147651,2005409799,2074964089,1985201273,2174160981,1965358009,2142987884,2124141200,2123564268,2043514774,1978291154,1619751255,2062457444,2072084781,2148200724,1983742724,2002972888,2176417267,2043831111,1974992986,2289190183,2085873135,2125281275,2100055302,1898890511,2171575383,2062463872,1986637027,2174462014,2128062444,2059738590,1938960447,2229711034,2169277953,2105942117,2173880861,1941426989,1999037513,2063295526,2048485366,2105384926,2102846561,1984983544,1550598685,2034144235,2062219811,2015071882,2135462719,1965241133,2171125351,2133791054,2033160101,2043644850,1989246564,1994800218,2140001392,1617904705,1934263059,1924860203,2088151138,2134720554,1497261301,1658326591,1971880248,2048351585,2132304065,2158143330,2066850544,2158569873,2169242888,2388847782,2097825069,2237559385,2056453952,2058730863,2098654378,2139223514,2142967805,2050413070,2074767856,2252920674,2100984388,2066165799,2144133989,1700325832,2139417782,2145861670,2098730767,2038473673,1967170772,2109378699,2180301600,1851524102,2137101078,2102197928,2125453764,2102160239,2315357523,2089439943,2102004532,2028459940,2038592739,2095785471,2158317250,2118884916,2149413089,2033054846,1858915186,2124705466,1966499954,1964772454,2018805546,2094320489,2128772124,2096164598,2098254516,2107602834,1002755731,2056557542,2047208054,904621797,2064908013,1837968393,1983836714,2006514423,1556515778,2138932870,1989997544,2117102018,2035013501,1989058095,2020485766,2059729743,1750913516,2096654418,2048441179,2136563179,2079778790,1990701941,2101284100,2126509979,2150259853,2061501879,2009560512,1980641310,2015065872,2134934579,2111874475,2050710625,2001786727,2134270795,1589711561,2170349739,2099285484,2094923214,2059977944,2085833214,1987484552,2335961323,1977872526,2113176916,2091142565,2121273076,2120514973,2143238780,1667213644,2058236338,2156309899,2123355591,2138748819],"citationsCount":27,"abstract":"The last quarter century spans the publication of the first assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1990 and the latest report published in 2013–2014. The five assessment reports appearing over that interval reveal a marked increase in the number of paleoclimate studies addressing the climate of the last 2000 years (the Common Era). An important focus of this work has been on reconstruction of hemispheric and global temperatures. Several early studies in this area generated considerable scientific and public interest, and were followed by high-profile and sometimes vitriolic debates about the magnitude of temperature changes over all or part of the Common Era and their comparison to 20th- and 21st-century global temperature increases due to increasing levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Behind the more public debates, however, several consistent themes of scientific inquiry have developed to better characterize climate variability and change over the Common Era. These include attempts to collect more climate proxy archives and understand the signals they contain, improve the statistical methods used to estimate past temperature variability from proxies and their associated uncertainties, and to compare reconstructed temperature variability and change with climate model simulations. All of these efforts are driving a new age of research on the climate of the Common Era that is developing more cohesive and collaborative investigations into the dynamics of climate on time scales of decades to centuries, and an understanding of the implications for modeled climate projections of the future.

Since systematic instrumental temperature records only extend back to the nineteenth century, such knowledge mainly relies on climate-sensitive proxy data. Here we critically assess some of the many challenges related to large-scale multiproxy temperature reconstructions. We begin with a review of available large-scale temperature reconstructions, focusing on the differences in low-frequency variability and the response to natural forcings such as major volcanic eruptions and changes in total solar irradiance. Then, we discuss different proxy selection strategies, review previously used reconstruction methods, and discuss their ability to reconstruct the amplitude of the low-frequency variability. To shed additional light on the challenges of large-scale reconstructions, we investigate the spatial and temporal correlation structures in the observed temperature field and discuss the implications of these correlation structures regarding the required number and positions of proxies. We demonstrate how the unavoidable uncertainty related to noisy proxies will show up as bias and variance in the reconstruction and that the partition between these forms of errors depends on the reconstruction method. Pseudo-proxy experiments are conducted to further discuss the influence of noise and the requirements regarding the geographical location and number of proxies necessary for reliably reconstructing the low-frequency variability. We conclude with recommendations for future large-scale temperature reconstructions."},{"id":1980730034,"microsoftAcademicId":1980730034,"doi":"10.5194/cp-11-533-2015","title":"Technical Note: Probabilistically constraining proxy age–depth models within a Bayesian hierarchical reconstruction model","authors":[{"LN":"Werner","FN":"J.

Reconstructions of the late-Holocene climate rely heavily upon proxies that are assumed to be accurately dated by layer counting, such as measurements of tree rings, ice cores, and varved lake sediments. Considerable advances could be achieved if time-uncertain proxies were able to be included within these multiproxy reconstructions, and if time uncertainties were recognized and correctly modeled for proxies commonly treated as free of age model errors.<br><br><br>Current approaches for accounting for time uncertainty are generally limited to repeating the reconstruction using each one of an ensemble of age models, thereby inflating the final estimated uncertainty – in effect, each possible age model is given equal weighting. Uncertainties can be reduced by exploiting the inferred space–time covariance structure of the climate to re-weight the possible age models. Here, we demonstrate how Bayesian hierarchical climate reconstruction models can be augmented to account for time-uncertain proxies. Critically, although a priori all age models are given equal probability of being correct, the probabilities associated with the age models are formally updated within the Bayesian framework, thereby reducing uncertainties. Numerical experiments show that updating the age model probabilities decreases uncertainty in the resulting reconstructions, as compared with the current de facto standard of sampling over all age models, provided there is sufficient information from other data sources in the spatial region of the time-uncertain proxy. This approach can readily be generalized to non-layer-counted proxies, such as those derived from marine sediments."},{"id":2094688663,"microsoftAcademicId":2094688663,"doi":"10.1175/jcli3612.1","title":"Present-Day Atmospheric Simulations Using GISS ModelE: Comparison to In Situ, Satellite, and Reanalysis Data","authors":[{"LN":"Schmidt","FN":"Gavin A."},{"LN":"Ruedy","FN":"Reto"},{"LN":"Hansen","FN":"James E."},{"LN":"Aleinov","FN":"Igor"},{"LN":"Bell","FN":"Nadine"},{"LN":"Bauer","FN":"Mike"},{"LN":"Bauer","FN":"Susanne"},{"LN":"Cairns","FN":"Brian"},{"LN":"Canuto","FN":"Vittorio"},{"LN":"Cheng","FN":"Ye"},{"LN":"Genio","FN":"Anthony Del"},{"LN":"Faluvegi","FN":"Greg"},{"LN":"Friend","FN":"Andrew D."},{"LN":"Hall","FN":"Tim M."},{"LN":"Hu","FN":"Yongyun"},{"LN":"Kelley","FN":"Max"},{"LN":"Kiang","FN":"Nancy Y."},{"LN":"Koch","FN":"Dorothy"},{"LN":"Lacis","FN":"Andy A."},{"LN":"Lerner","FN":"Jean"},{"LN":"Lo","FN":"Ken K."},{"LN":"Miller","FN":"Ron L."},{"LN":"Nazarenko","FN":"Larissa"},{"LN":"Oinas","FN":"Valdar"},{"LN":"Perlwitz","FN":"Jan"},{"LN":"Perlwitz","FN":"Judith"},{"LN":"Rind","FN":"David"},{"LN":"Romanou","FN":"Anastasia"},{"LN":"Russell","FN":"Gary L."},{"LN":"Sato","FN":"Makiko"},{"LN":"Shindell","FN":"Drew T."},{"LN":"Stone","FN":"Peter H."},{"LN":"Sun","FN":"Shan"},{"LN":"Tausnev","FN":"Nick"},{"LN":"Thresher","FN":"Duane"},{"LN":"Yao","FN":"Mao-Sung"}],"year":2006,"journal":"Journal of Climate","references":[1522296012,2006165291,2020297738,2176956584,1985479415,2096809505,2045470555,2133484165,1579893055,2013537840,2137169911,2019812041,67812752,2106256460,2038742869,1969583657,2006563460,2148592335,1997499217,1547067099,2157002639,2097052086,2154409236,2041158780,168399174,2155654615,2159110989,2094611979,2054652969,2000464111,2055902907,1625533523,2146719438,1510447231,59815194,1963676515,2044940833,1981646498,2148487473,2104127988,2026422942,1989790045,2059756096,2043986368,1979939918,2056751206,2089785418,2176990229,1987461785,2121994682,2074435632,2170547250,1972125997,2115950861,2134362679,2158992723,2090785751,2059205508,2054088207,159995897,1998835472,1976144170,1758058526,2029896116,2047442548,1562616331,2146309740,1976913624,1974605993,2152846021,2015179509,1963536423,2072992577,2148233761,2042058640,1972515913,2075609411,1977314054,2040620579,2003636035,1973508392,1965981379,2006459809,2173218178,2035741722,2174517447,2144616126,1996871720,2075954098,2118739416,2084107098,1967170772,2118471988,2040195880,1969005344,1973707151,2162655192,2119531124,2180259585,2060969273,2173752470,1978547911,2143704430,2180666548,2066992347,2092625175,2033226370,1911533441,2057285747,2084172080,2115013012,2180384338,2179455917,2022435121,1999123335,2140343068,2102421198,1989028309,2021598361,2116584463,2060782609,2127415689,2091534926,2159713378,1990354284,921371042,1979895664,2119980699,2171279241,2048329214,2130683466,2147538817,1973872808,1988064628,1963975479,1967603464,2028550668,2156956984,1979550685,2173031829,2036772899,2107401151,2092034699,1939914269,955005786,2177368025,2006513589,2179375492,757317082,1524974880,2057129049,2143871731,25854986,1605845253],"citationsCount":830,"citationContext":{"59815194":["Ocean and ocean ice are treated as rough bluff surface, with z0m combining the smooth surface value (Brutsaert 1982) with the Charnock relation for the aerodynamic roughness length;

Geogr. Ann., 87 A (1): 17-36. ABSTRACT. This review focuses on the develop- ment of the 'Little Ice Age' as a glaciological and cli- matic concept, and evaluates its current usefulness in the light of new data on the glacier and climatic variations of the last millennium and of the Holocene. 'Little Ice Age' glacierization occurred over about 650 years and can be defined most pre- cisely in the European Alps (c. AD 1300-1950) when extended glaciers were larger than before or since. 'Little Ice Age' climate is defined as a shorter time interval of about 330 years (c. AD 1570-1900) when Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures (land areas north of 20°N) fell significantly below the AD 1961-1990 mean. This climatic definition overlaps the times when the Alpine glaciers attained their lat- est two highstands (AD 1650 and 1850). It is empha- sized, however, that 'Little Ice Age' glacierization was highly dependent on winter precipitation and that 'Little Ice Age' climate was not simply a matter of summer temperatures. Both the glacier-centred and the climate-centred concepts necessarily en- compass considerable spatial and temporal varia- bility, which are investigated using maps of mean summer temperature variations over the Northern Hemisphere at 30-year intervals from AD 1571 to 1900. 'Little Ice Age'-type events occurred earlier in the Holocene as exemplified by at least seven gla- cier expansion episodes that have been identified in southern Norway. Such events provide a broader context and renewed relevance for the 'Little Ice Age', which may be viewed as a 'modern analogue' for the earlier events; and the likelihood that similar events will occur in the future has implications for climatic change in the twenty-first century. It is con- cluded that the concept of a 'Little Ice Age' will re- main useful only by (1) continuing to incorporate the temporal and spatial complexities of glacier and climatic variations as they become better known, and (2) by reflecting improved understanding of the Earth-atmosphere-ocean system and its forcing factors through the interaction of palaeoclimatic re- construction with climate modelling."},{"id":2348085231,"microsoftAcademicId":2348085231,"doi":"10.1175/jcli-d-13-00781.1","title":"Australasian Temperature Reconstructions Spanning the Last Millennium","authors":[{"LN":"Gergis","FN":"Joelle Lyndsay","affil":"University of Melbourne"},{"LN":"Neukom","FN":"Raphael","affil":"University of Bern"},{"LN":"Neukom","FN":"Raphael","affil":"University of Zurich"},{"LN":"Gallant","FN":"Ailie","affil":"University of Melbourne"},{"LN":"Karoly","FN":"David John","affil":"University of Melbourne"}],"year":2016,"journal":"Journal of Climate","references":[2006165291,1979440117,2096809505,2070257026,2108531121,1982846260,2151746416,2078580016,2094688663,1980106771,2135496572,2146079950,2042859974,2083178128,2074964089,2156102187,2038669354,1981256179,2123564268,1978291154,1606803730,2147569451,2177291244,2068090847,2117917479,2075746856,2062457444,2097872776,1992866464,2175808424,1983742724,2062778690,2095538499,2007377949,2141117266,2255080690,1560946750,1974992986,2087236725,1996250618,2090246574,2052478647,2007012175,1631967728,2139892221,2146937853,2155224709,2122125911,2096763947,2105942117,1965514539,2082073896,2034144235,2038006301,2062219811,2171125351,2133791054,2024259303,2063340639,2008832614,1983113873,2095817630,1970995858,2624731095,2138785184,2170436314,2014968686,2018798324,2123920604,1892599811,2097825069,2237559385,2070137502,2145917310,2001737915,1976810938,2008537817,2024745830,1991045371,2019804337,2080994223,2134564284,2083714093,2116011402,2102197928,2086399840,2050458479,2075218266,1995676835,1525400741,1561001428,2014602425,2120120577,2115965836,2017700157,2077556333,2140157892,1908697507,2089605147,2157574221,2073551447,2005686580,1968654705,2133936217,2099794669,2003409151,1964647748,2055498028,1978874030,2116616038,1530011496,2046418169,2066794100,954445893,2100075457,2162140237,2019885534,2106850978,1513857566,2021329690,2092914914,2737621896,2005265029,1928887355,2051525724,1971906034,1577101586,2069038387,1577662763,1961773873,2598382724,2121273076,1484250421,2039990632,2000777479],"citationsCount":22,"abstract":"AbstractMultiproxy warm season (September–February) temperature reconstructions are presented for the combined land–ocean region of Australasia (0°–50°S, 110°E–180°) covering 1000–2001.

A skilful rainfall reconstruction for the 1783–1988 period was possible using twelve annually-resolved palaeoclimate records from the Australasian region. An innovative Monte Carlo calibration and verification technique is introduced to provide the robust uncertainty estimates needed for reliable climate reconstructions. Our ensemble median reconstruction captures 33% of inter-annual and 72% of decadal variations in instrumental SEA rainfall observations. We investigate the stability of regional SEA rainfall with large-scale circulation associated with El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) over the past 206 years. We find evidence for a robust relationship with high SEA rainfall, ENSO and the IPO over the 1840–1988 period. These relationships break down in the late 18th–early 19th century, coinciding with a known period of equatorial Pacific Sea Surface Temperature (SST) cooling during one of the most severe periods of the Little Ice Age. In comparison to a markedly wetter late 18th/early 19th century containing 75% of sustained wet years, 70% of all reconstructed sustained dry years in SEA occur during the 20th century. In the context of the rainfall estimates introduced here, there is a 97.1% probability that the decadal rainfall anomaly recorded during the 1998–2008 ‘Big Dry’ is the worst experienced since the first European settlement of Australia."},{"id":1826016929,"microsoftAcademicId":1826016929,"doi":"10.1002/env.2368","title":"Reconstruction of late Holocene climate based on tree growth and mechanistic hierarchical models","authors":[{"LN":"Tipton","FN":"John","affil":"Colorado State University"},{"LN":"Hooten","FN":"Mevin B.","affil":"Colorado State University"},{"LN":"Hooten","FN":"Mevin B.","affil":"United States Geological Survey"},{"LN":"Pederson","FN":"Neil","affil":"Harvard University"},{"LN":"Tingley","FN":"Martin","affil":"Pennsylvania State University"},{"LN":"Bishop","FN":"Daniel","affil":"Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory"}],"year":2016,"journal":"Environmetrics","references":[2582743722,1981457167,2025720061,2148534890,146619314,2030597423,2130715829,1566333899,2054167751,2151746416,2075965721,2067409327,2074964089,2048776980,2106201557,1981256179,2123564268,2396871564,2283666662,2114100577,2002972888,2087236725,2003326514,2100055302,2161132263,568352374,2174462014,2105942117,1997369189,2034144235,2165562007,2157129937,1989246564,1511839553,2121013971,1618765701,2097825069,1993644449,2153536767,2180301600,2137101078,1976041275,2118636179,1997557228,2091300140,2056557542,70397570,2055206019,1980730034,2079778790,2159837990,2138537852,2071398965],"citationsCount":11,"citationContext":{"2030597423":["Implementation of a hybrid Metropolis–Hastings and Gibbs MCMC algorithm allows for estimation of the posterior distribution (Banerjee et al., 2004; Carlin and Louis, 2011)."],"2087236725":["To validate our predictive model, we translate and scale the reconstruction of Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) in Pederson et al.

Statistical prediction of paleoclimate from tree ring widths is challenging because tree ring widths are a one-dimensional summary of annual growth that represents a multi-dimensional set of climatic and biotic influences. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical framework using a nonlinear, biologically motivated tree ring growth model to jointly reconstruct temperature and precipitation in the Hudson Valley, New York. Using a common growth function to describe the response of a tree to climate, we allow for species-specific parameterizations of the growth response. To enable predictive backcasts, we model the climate variables with a vector autoregressive process on an annual timescale coupled with a multivariate conditional autoregressive process that accounts for temporal correlation and cross-correlation between temperature and precipitation on a monthly scale. Our multi-scale temporal model allows for flexibility in the climate response through time at different temporal scales and predicts reasonable climate scenarios given tree ring width data.

Nine annually resolved paleoclimate proxy records from the Australasian region are used to develop a reconstruction of streamflow from 1783 to 1988. An ensemble of reconstructions is presented, providing probabilistic estimates of River Murray flows for each year back in time. The best-estimate reconstruction captures approximately 23% (50%) of annual (decadal) naturalized streamflow variability. High and low streamflow phases and their association with decadal climate variability in the Pacific are discussed. Reconstructed River Murray streamflow shows considerable variation since 1783. We estimate that there is a 2.3% chance that the 1998–2008 record low decadal streamflow deficit has been exceeded since European settlement. Stochastic simulations of the decadal variations in River Murray streamflow are computed using the paleostreamflow reconstruction to estimate model parameters. From these simulations, we estimate that the 1998–2008 streamflow deficit has an approximate 1 in 1500 year return period. As climate models are assessed relative to short instrumental records, future projections of decadal-scale variations in Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) streamflow may be inadequately represented. Given the immense socioeconomic importance of Australia's “food bowl,” future paleoclimate and modeling efforts should be directed at understanding variability at this scale. This would greatly enhance our capacity to estimate regional sensitivity of the MDB's hydroclimate to further anthropogenic influences."},{"id":2122004905,"microsoftAcademicId":2122004905,"doi":"10.5194/gmd-5-649-2012","title":"The CSIRO Mk3L climate system model version 1.0 – Part 2: Response to external forcings","authors":[{"LN":"Phipps","FN":"S.

The CSIRO Mk3L climate system model is a coupled general circulation model, designed primarily for millennial-scale climate simulation and palaeoclimate research. Mk3L includes components which describe the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and land surface, and combines computational efficiency with a stable and realistic control climatology. It is freely available to the research community. This paper evaluates the response of the model to external forcings which correspond to past and future changes in the climate system.<br><br><br>A simulation of the mid-Holocene climate is performed, in which changes in the seasonal and meridional distribution of incoming solar radiation are imposed. Mk3L correctly simulates increased summer temperatures at northern mid-latitudes and cooling in the tropics. However, it is unable to capture some of the regional-scale features of the mid-Holocene climate, with the precipitation over Northern Africa being deficient. The model simulates a reduction of between 7 and 15% in the amplitude of El Nino-Southern Oscillation, a smaller decrease than that implied by the palaeoclimate record. However, the realism of the simulated ENSO is limited by the model's relatively coarse spatial resolution.<br><br><br>Transient simulations of the late Holocene climate are then performed. The evolving distribution of insolation is imposed, and an acceleration technique is applied and assessed. The model successfully captures the temperature changes in each hemisphere and the upward trend in ENSO variability. However, the lack of a dynamic vegetation scheme does not allow it to simulate an abrupt desertification of the Sahara.<br><br><br>To assess the response of Mk3L to other forcings, transient simulations of the last millennium are performed. Changes in solar irradiance, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and volcanic emissions are applied to the model. The model is again broadly successful at simulating larger-scale changes in the climate system. Both the magnitude and the spatial pattern of the simulated 20th century warming are consistent with observations. However, the model underestimates the magnitude of the relative warmth associated with the Mediaeval Climate Anomaly.<br><br><br>Finally, three transient simulations are performed, in which the atmospheric CO2 concentration is stabilised at two, three and four times the pre-industrial value. All three simulations exhibit ongoing surface warming, reduced sea ice cover, and a reduction in the rate of North Atlantic Deep Water formation followed by its gradual recovery. Antarctic Bottom Water formation ceases, with the shutdown being permanent for a trebling and quadrupling of the CO2 concentration. The transient and equilibrium climate sensitivities of the model are determined. The short-term transient response to a doubling of the CO2 concentration at 1% per year is a warming of 1.59 ± 0.08 K, while the long-term equilibrium response is a warming of at least 3.85 ± 0.02 K."},{"id":2004438678,"microsoftAcademicId":2004438678,"doi":"10.1029/tr020i004p00518","title":"Report of Committee on Glaciers, April 1939","authors":[{"LN":"Matthes","FN":"François E.","affil":"United States Geological Survey"}],"year":1939,"journal":"Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union","references":[],"citationsCount":188,"abstract":"The Committee on Glaciers at present is constituted as follows:\r\n\r\nHarry Fielding Reid—Professor-Emeritus of Geology, Johns Hopkins University (former member of the International Glacier Commission), 608 Cathedral Street, Baltimore, Maryland\r\n\r\nWilliam H.

This model includes an interactive carbon cycle, a representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, and a comprehensive representation of aerosols. As it represents the principal dynamical, physical, and bio-geochemical processes relevant to the climate system, it may be referred to as an Earth System Model. However, the IPSL-CM5 model may be used in a multitude of configurations associated with different boundary conditions and with a range of complexities in terms of processes and interactions. This paper presents an overview of the different model components and explains how they were coupled and used to simulate historical climate changes over the past 150 years and different scenarios of future climate change. A single version of the IPSL-CM5 model (IPSL-CM5A-LR) was used to provide climate projections associated with different socio-economic scenarios, including the different Representative Concentration Pathways considered by CMIP5 and several scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios considered by CMIP3. Results suggest that the magnitude of global warming projections primarily depends on the socio-economic scenario considered, that there is potential for an aggressive mitigation policy to limit global warming to about two degrees, and that the behavior of some components of the climate system such as the Arctic sea ice and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation may change drastically by the end of the twenty-first century in the case of a no climate policy scenario. Although the magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes depends fairly linearly on the magnitude of the projected global warming (and thus on the scenario considered), the geographical pattern of these changes is strikingly similar for the different scenarios. The representation of atmospheric physical processes in the model is shown to strongly influence the simulated climate variability and both the magnitude and pattern of the projected climate changes."},{"id":1983066276,"microsoftAcademicId":1983066276,"doi":"10.1126/science.1132588","title":"ENSO as an Integrating Concept in Earth Science","authors":[{"LN":"McPhaden","FN":"Michael J.","affil":"Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory"},{"LN":"Zebiak","FN":"Stephen E.","affil":"International Research Institute for Climate and Society, Palisades, NY, USA."},{"LN":"Glantz","FN":"Michael H.","affil":"National Center for Atmospheric Research"}],"year":2006,"journal":"Science","references":[2024649846,2058662258,2061328952,2149567119,1999733221,2150700909,2021705657,1975039560,2059603179,2104511903,1970020090,2021470958,2141604188,2147569451,2063940323,1482932425,2139455631,1980051345,2041168744,2142896906,2046375586,2061877716,1490949357,2047434938,1665630250,2744598003,2098596506,1987611973,1982221421,2113105984,2024717797,2047309253],"citationsCount":923,"citationContext":{"1975039560":["Historically, droughtrelated crop failures due to El Nino were a major contributor to famine that would periodically devastate vulnerable populations ( 53 )."]},"abstract":"The El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle of alternating warm El Nino and cold La Nina events is the dominant year-to-year climate signal on Earth.

This paper describes the ocean state and circulation as well as basic aspects of variability in simulations contributing to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The performance of the ocean/sea-ice model MPIOM, coupled to a new version of the atmosphere model ECHAM6 and modules for land surface and ocean biogeochemistry, is assessed for two model versions with different grid resolution in the ocean. The low-resolution configuration has a nominal resolution of 1.5°, whereas the higher resolution version features a quasiuniform, eddy-permitting global resolution of 0.4°. The paper focuses on important oceanic features, such as surface temperature and salinity, water mass distribution, large-scale circulation, and heat and freshwater transports. In general, these integral quantities are simulated well in comparison with observational estimates, and improvements in comparison with the predecessor system are documented; for example, for tropical variability and sea ice representation. Introducing an eddy-permitting grid configuration in the ocean leads to improvements, in particular, in the representation of interior water mass properties in the Atlantic and in the representation of important ocean currents, such as the Agulhas and Equatorial current systems. In general, however, there are more similarities than differences between the two grid configurations, and several shortcomings, known from earlier versions of the coupled model, prevail."},{"id":2794728810,"microsoftAcademicId":2794728810,"doi":"10.1038/s41586-018-0006-5","title":"Observed fingerprint of a weakening Atlantic Ocean overturning circulation","authors":[{"LN":"Caesar","FN":"L.","affil":"Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research"},{"LN":"Caesar","FN":"L.","affil":"University of Potsdam"},{"LN":"Rahmstorf","FN":"S.","affil":"Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research"},{"LN":"Rahmstorf","FN":"S.","affil":"University of Potsdam"},{"LN":"Robinson","FN":"Alexander","affil":"Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research (PIK), Potsdam, Germany"},{"LN":"Feulner","FN":"G.","affil":"Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research"},{"LN":"Saba","FN":"V.","affil":"National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Nature","references":[2024966118,2924055038,2006165291,2131477567,1608013130,2108527489,2073141004,2024081693,2072228305,2144736649,2035891155,2968634674,2001061636,2010690624,2022350358,2108684521,1991467573,2124140738,2738516213,2108274925,2007880286,2213026911,2359575120,2064581421,2012119251,2415523405,2965874548,2013485750,1986954778,2278081136,1501961051,2118661143,2050680642,2560619159,2160497360,2007729656,2070541435,2568521921,2460183554,1987585697,1996140761,2287711206,2107446221,2402643682,2041814657,2016238032,2473336205,2752993302,2174880766,2556251739,2623792081,2125304624,2738916952,2591396142,1862158195,2066418536,2105997303,2077040264,2125332228,2123668931,2245428403,2749095415,2751448001,2588323478],"citationsCount":126,"abstract":"The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)—a system of ocean currents in the North Atlantic—has a major impact on climate, yet its evolution during the industrial era is poorly known owing to a lack of direct current measurements. Here we provide evidence for a weakening of the AMOC by about 3 ± 1 sverdrups (around 15 per cent) since the mid-twentieth century. This weakening is revealed by a characteristic spatial and seasonal sea-surface temperature ‘fingerprint’—consisting of a pattern of cooling in the subpolar Atlantic Ocean and warming in the Gulf Stream region—and is calibrated through an ensemble of model simulations from the CMIP5 project. We find this fingerprint both in a high-resolution climate model in response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and in the temperature trends observed since the late nineteenth century. The pattern can be explained by a slowdown in the AMOC and reduced northward heat transport, as well as an associated northward shift of the Gulf Stream.

Here, within the framework of the PAGES Antarctica2k working group, we build an enlarged database of ice core water stable isotope records from Antarctica, consisting of 112 records. We produce both unweighted and weighted isotopic ( δ<br>18 O) composites and temperature reconstructions since 0 CE, binned at 5- and 10-year resolution, for seven climatically distinct regions covering the Antarctic continent. Following earlier work of the Antarctica2k working group, we also produce composites and reconstructions for the broader regions of East Antarctica, West Antarctica and the whole continent. We use three methods for our temperature reconstructions: (i) a temperature scaling based on the<br>δ<br>18 O–temperature relationship output from an ECHAM5-wiso model simulation nudged to ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalyses from 1979 to 2013, and adjusted for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet region to borehole temperature data, (ii) a temperature scaling of the isotopic normalized anomalies to the variance of the regional reanalysis temperature and (iii) a composite-plus-scaling approach used in a previous continent-scale reconstruction of Antarctic temperature since 1 CE but applied to the new Antarctic ice core database. Our new reconstructions confirm a significant cooling trend from 0 to 1900 CE across all Antarctic regions where records extend back into the 1st millennium, with the exception of the Wilkes Land coast and Weddell Sea coast regions. Within this long-term cooling trend from 0 to 1900 CE, we find that the warmest period occurs between 300 and 1000 CE, and the coldest interval occurs from 1200 to 1900 CE. Since 1900 CE, significant warming trends are identified for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the Dronning Maud Land coast and the Antarctic Peninsula regions, and these trends are robust across the distribution of records that contribute to the unweighted isotopic composites and also significant in the weighted temperature reconstructions. Only for the Antarctic Peninsula is this most recent century-scale trend unusual in the context of natural variability over the last 2000 years. However, projected warming of the Antarctic continent during the 21st century may soon see significant and unusual warming develop across other parts of the Antarctic continent. The extended Antarctica2k ice core isotope database developed by this working group opens up many avenues for developing a deeper understanding of the response of Antarctic climate to natural and anthropogenic climate forcings. The first long-term quantification of regional climate in Antarctica presented herein is a basis for data–model comparison and assessments of past, present and future driving factors of Antarctic climate."},{"id":2789150848,"microsoftAcademicId":2789150848,"doi":"10.1038/s41558-017-0059-8","title":"Challenges and opportunities for improved understanding of regional climate dynamics","authors":[{"LN":"Collins","FN":"Matthew","affil":"University of Exeter"},{"LN":"Minobe","FN":"Shoshiro","affil":"Hokkaido University"},{"LN":"Barreiro","FN":"Marcelo","affil":"Departamento de Ciencias de la Atmósfera, Facultad de Ciencias — Universidad de la República, Montevideo, Uruguay"},{"LN":"Bordoni","FN":"Simona","affil":"California Institute of Technology"},{"LN":"Kaspi","FN":"Yohai","affil":"Weizmann Institute of Science"},{"LN":"Kuwano-Yoshida","FN":"Akira","affil":"Kyoto University"},{"LN":"Keenlyside","FN":"Noel","affil":"Geophysical Institute, University of Bergen"},{"LN":"Manzini","FN":"Elisa","affil":"Max Planck Society"},{"LN":"O'Reilly","FN":"Christopher H.","affil":"University of Oxford"},{"LN":"Sutton","FN":"Rowan","affil":"University of Reading"},{"LN":"Xie","FN":"Shang-Ping","affil":"University of California, San Diego"},{"LN":"Zolina","FN":"Olga","affil":"Shirshov Institute of Oceanology"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Nature Climate Change","references":[2939474406,2122511023,1970327765,2170174991,2146487757,1977699466,1974470230,1789155650,2001061636,2152928439,1930393311,2132357963,2023439090,2030472866,2031964839,1964247113,1981985366,2164094029,2033013208,1972747475,2153463079,2109215244,1992392014,2242446634,2047294871,2008642300,2007880286,2169929206,2161275908,2025163476,2227024234,2103656156,2169074001,2055478960,2012580522,2001434030,2129390744,1977020983,2550337802,2042028973,2495381740,2263496280,2125996960,2472149562,2097090023,2022831624,1981023054,2160497360,1997339222,1985695858,2124327792,2538529636,1820335993,2050962553,1967753047,1981854042,2512447799,2063217576,2465405073,2601622117,2060192481,2009018246,2511784814,2510807300,1543126162,2270241547,2522245011,2028992168,2210537207,2307936365,2019642706,1999299981,2154639340,2046966552,2515727093,2531838422,2263216405,2969568162,2011330240,2301858794,2108665956,2346853756,2748442592,2007739106,2175698080,865995943,1958924301,2767851785,2155089063,2133289123,2617824152,2886267097,2068971518,2192054605,2620973384,2230262340,1951383380,2309855430,2738817455,2587886301,2081216378,2601486367,2060392698,2143043219,1570063173],"citationsCount":14,"abstract":"Dynamical processes in the atmosphere and ocean are central to determining the large-scale drivers of regional climate change, yet their predictive understanding is poor.

Understanding this period and the subsequent slowdown of warming is key to disentangling the relationship between decadal variability and the response to human influences in the present and future climate. This review discusses the observed changes during the ETCW and hypotheses for the underlying causes and mechanisms. Attribution studies estimate that about a half (40-54%; p > .8) of the global warming from 1901 to 1950 was forced by a combination of increasing greenhouse gases and natural forcing, offset to some extent by aerosols. Natural variability also made a large contribution, particularly to regional anomalies like the Arctic warming in the 1920s and 1930s. The ETCW period also encompassed exceptional events, several of which are touched upon: Indian monsoon failures during the turn of the century, the \"Dust Bowl\" droughts and extreme heat waves in North America in the 1930s, the World War II period drought in Australia between 1937 and 1945; and the European droughts and heat waves of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Understanding the mechanisms involved in these events, and their links to large scale forcing is an important test for our understanding of modern climate change and for predicting impacts of future change.

Here, we assess the potential sources of these discrepancies by comparing 1000-year hemispheric temperature reconstructions based on real-world paleoclimate proxies with climate-model-based pseudoproxies. These pseudoproxy experiments (PPE) indicate that noise inherent in proxy records and the unequal spatial distribution of proxy data are the key factors in explaining the data-model differences. For example, lower inter-hemispheric correlations in reconstructions can be fully accounted for by these factors in the PPE. Noise and data sampling also partly explain the reduced amplitude of the response to external forcing in reconstructions compared to models. For other metrics, such as inter-hemispheric differences, some, although reduced, discrepancy remains. Our results suggest that improving proxy data quality and spatial coverage is the key factor to increase the quality of future climate reconstructions, while the total number of proxy records and reconstruction methodology play a smaller role."},{"id":2802337287,"microsoftAcademicId":2802337287,"doi":"10.5194/cp-14-527-2018","title":"Spatio-temporal variability of Arctic summer temperatures over the past 2 millennia","authors":[{"LN":"Werner","FN":"Johannes P.","affil":"Bjerknes Centre for Climate Research"},{"LN":"Divine","FN":"Dmitry V.","affil":"University of Tromsø"},{"LN":"Divine","FN":"Dmitry V.","affil":"Norwegian Polar Institute"},{"LN":"Ljungqvist","FN":"Fredrik Charpentier","affil":"Stockholm University"},{"LN":"Nilsen","FN":"Tine","affil":"University of Tromsø"},{"LN":"Francus","FN":"Pierre","affil":"Institut national de la recherche scientifique"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Climate of The Past","references":[1520428197,1867005924,2025720061,2117443107,2107733948,2065232353,2024417959,2096830549,2135496572,2160036711,1830138900,2123559861,1948827418,2170171286,2122809335,2020767027,2099416373,2142987884,2116030881,2299597119,2178242555,1532349165,2062457444,2119689998,185797722,2011806334,2129931697,1969764636,2289190183,2100055302,2169784278,2043278879,2125834098,2624462411,2105942117,2121311122,2329499864,2032072047,2104440722,2161680946,1989241928,2159252479,2155142364,2121138676,1971880248,2088668253,2166529422,2122114567,2022729526,1826016929,1976810938,2158794134,2145861670,2730628963,2094444468,2804068631,2109378699,2118960317,2467008671,1851524102,2012623757,2137101078,2013828546,2158317250,2116686897,2080387613,2043479942,2313381310,2099679592,1648138309,2049168373,2086060322,2057868074,2561238029,1972094069,904621797,2168115048,2132867692,2150749664,1980730034,2150348651,2117102018,2002101446,2110915584,2149192442,2150583179,2023151740,2043212204,2285664460,1780033858,1875860844,2043440997,2126509979,1971454109,2149533233,2068335207,2033966124,2113160236,2768951849,2210438912,2161925367,2286293573,2062610749,2034765376,2046775047,2770824587,2139997679,2810560761,2092369677,2791681693,2740346623],"citationsCount":12,"abstract":"In this article, the first spatially resolved and millennium-length summer (June–August) temperature reconstruction over the Arctic and sub-Arctic domain (north of 60° N) is presented. It is based on a set of 44 annually dated temperature-sensitive proxy archives of various types from the revised PAGES2k database supplemented with six new recently updated proxy records. As a major advance, an extension of the Bayesian BARCAST climate field (CF) reconstruction technique provides a means to treat climate archives with dating uncertainties. This results not only in a more precise reconstruction but additionally enables joint probabilistic constraints to be imposed on the chronologies of the used archives. The new seasonal CF reconstruction for the Arctic region can be shown to be skilful for the majority of the terrestrial nodes. The decrease in the proxy data density back in time, however, limits the analyses in the spatial domain to the period after 750 CE, while the spatially averaged reconstruction covers the entire time interval of 1–2002 CE.<br>The centennial to millennial evolution of the reconstructed temperature is in good agreement with a general pattern that was inferred in recent studies for the Arctic and its subregions. In particular, the reconstruction shows a pronounced Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; here ca. 920–1060 CE), which was characterised by a sequence of extremely warm decades over the whole domain. The medieval warming was followed by a gradual cooling into the Little Ice Age (LIA), with 1766–1865 CE as the longest centennial-scale cold period, culminating around 1811–1820 CE for most of the target region.<br>In total over 600 independent realisations of the temperature CF were generated. As showcased for local and regional trends and temperature anomalies, operating in a probabilistic framework directly results in comprehensive uncertainty estimates, even for complex analyses. For the presented multi-scale trend analysis, for example, the spread in different paths across the reconstruction ensemble prevents a robust analysis of features at timescales shorter than ca. 30 years. For the spatial reconstruction, the benefit of using the spatially resolved reconstruction ensemble is demonstrated by focusing on the regional expression of the recent warming and the MCA. While our analysis shows that the peak MCA summer temperatures were as high as in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the spatial coherence of extreme years over the last decades of the reconstruction (1980s onwards) seems unprecedented at least back until 750 CE. However, statistical testing could not provide conclusive support of the contemporary warming to exceed the peak of the MCA in terms of the pan-Arctic mean summer temperatures: the reconstruction cannot be extended reliably past 2002 CE due to lack of proxy data and thus the most recent warming is not captured."},{"id":2275791167,"microsoftAcademicId":2275791167,"doi":"10.1038/ngeo2566","title":"Corrigendum: Continental-scale temperature variability during the past two millennia","authors":[{"LN":"Ahmed","FN":"Moinuddin"},{"LN":"Anchukaitis","FN":"Kevin J."},{"LN":"Asrat","FN":"Asfawossen"},{"LN":"Borgaonkar","FN":"Hemant P."},{"LN":"Braida","FN":"Martina"},{"LN":"Buckley","FN":"Brendan M."},{"LN":"Büntgen","FN":"Ulf"},{"LN":"Chase","FN":"Brian M."},{"LN":"Christie","FN":"Duncan A."},{"LN":"Cook","FN":"Edward R."},{"LN":"Curran","FN":"Mark A.

This study addresses the possibility of carrying out spatially resolved global reconstructions of annual mean temperature using a worldwide network of proxy records and a method based on the search of analogues. Several variants of the method are evaluated, and their performance is analysed. As a test bed for the reconstruction, the PAGES 2k proxy database (version 1.9.0) is employed as a predictor, the HadCRUT4 dataset is the set of observations used as the predictand and target, and a set of simulations from the PMIP3 simulations are used as a pool to draw analogues and carry out pseudo-proxy experiments (PPEs). The performance of the variants of the analogue method (AM) is evaluated through a series of PPEs in growing complexity, from a perfect-proxy scenario to a realistic one where the pseudo-proxy records are contaminated with noise (white and red) and missing values, mimicking the limitations of actual proxies. Additionally, the method is tested by reconstructing the real observed HadCRUT4 temperature based on the calibration of real proxies. The reconstructed fields reproduce the observed decadal temperature variability. From all the tests, we can conclude that the analogue pool provided by the PMIP3 ensemble is large enough to reconstruct global annual temperatures during the Common Era. Furthermore, the search of analogues based on a metric that minimises the RMSE in real space outperforms other evaluated metrics, including the search of analogues in the range-reduced space expanded by the leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). These results show how the AM is able to spatially extrapolate the information of a network of local proxy records to produce a homogeneous gap-free climate field reconstruction with valuable information in areas barely covered by proxies and make the AM a suitable tool to produce valuable climate field reconstructions for the Common Era."},{"id":2796310947,"microsoftAcademicId":2796310947,"doi":"10.1029/2010wr009832","title":"An experimental streamflow reconstruction for the River Murray, Australia, 1783-1988: STREAMFLOW RECONSTRUCTION, RIVER MURRAY","authors":[{"LN":"Gallant","FN":"Ailie J.

This technique, using wavelet transformation, makes the most of the available palaeoclimate data. The resulting reconstruction supports the case that multicentennial natural variability has been larger than is commonly thought, and that considerable natural climate variation can be expected in future. High temperatures occurred during the tenth century and notable ‘lows’ around 1600. But post-1990 temperatures stand out still as higher than at any time in the previous 2,000 years. A number of reconstructions of millennial-scale climate variability have been carried out in order to understand patterns of natural climate variability, on decade to century timescales, and the role of anthropogenic forcing1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. These reconstructions have mainly used tree-ring data and other data sets of annual to decadal resolution. Lake and ocean sediments have a lower time resolution, but provide climate information at multicentennial timescales that may not be captured by tree-ring data9,10. Here we reconstruct Northern Hemisphere temperatures for the past 2,000 years by combining low-resolution proxies with tree-ring data, using a wavelet transform technique11 to achieve timescale-dependent processing of the data. Our reconstruction shows larger multicentennial variability than most previous multi-proxy reconstructions1,2,3,4,7, but agrees well with temperatures reconstructed from borehole measurements12 and with temperatures obtained with a general circulation model13,14. According to our reconstruction, high temperatures—similar to those observed in the twentieth century before 1990—occurred around ad 1000 to 1100, and minimum temperatures that are about 0.7 K below the average of 1961–90 occurred around ad 1600. This large natural variability in the past suggests an important role of natural multicentennial variability that is likely to continue."},{"id":1974992986,"microsoftAcademicId":1974992986,"doi":"10.1175/jcli4011.1","title":"Detection of Human Influence on a New, Validated 1500-Year Temperature Reconstruction","authors":[{"LN":"Hegerl","FN":"Gabriele C.","affil":"School of Geosciences"},{"LN":"Crowley","FN":"Thomas J.","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Allen","FN":"Myles","affil":"University of Oxford"},{"LN":"Hyde","FN":"William T.","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Pollack","FN":"Henry N.","affil":"University of Michigan"},{"LN":"Smerdon","FN":"Jason","affil":"Lamont–Doherty Earth Observatory"},{"LN":"Zorita","FN":"Eduardo"}],"year":2007,"journal":"Journal of Climate","references":[1979440117,2120115499,2070257026,1990899433,2131532072,2130256070,2054167751,2052890963,2027745714,2146079950,2126147651,2080002323,1968706437,1965358009,1978887368,2108379304,2142987884,1963650928,2136350156,2159110989,1978291154,1917188878,2039903648,2068090847,2173041566,2110420020,1975860235,1480747446,2124579984,1978403360,1965288265,2085873135,1996191392,2017963652,2048485366,2029052292,2135462719,2015179509,1994800218,2056393075,2144166588,2007397049,2088151138,2149828401,2160926016,1658326591,2080199880,2132304065,2158569873,2072434820,2144881309,2126502563,1964238113,2066165799,2100426086,2089439943,1969303178,2111081361,1963671295,2107602834,2008632889,2036159431,1973509059,37428245,2147617618,2150434214,2797592438],"citationsCount":280,"citationContext":{"1480747446":["The dependence of detection results on climate model control simulations is an important uncertainty in the attribution of climate change to causes (Mitchell et al. 2001).","The detected signal of greenhouse warming is consistent with results from the late twentieth century and thus supports the finding that most of the late-twentieth-century warming has been anthropogenic (e.g., Tett et al. 1999; Mitchell et al. 2001)."],"1963671295":["However, natural influences on climate, such as changes in volcanism and possibly solar radiation, are responsible for a substantial fraction of past climate variations (e.g.,  Robock and Free 1995;  Crowley 2000; Hegerl et al. 2003; Bertrand et al. 2002; Weber 2005; Stendel et al. 2005).\u001bResults using the CH-blend reconstruction show that its decadal temperature variability is largely driven by external forcing (typically 60%–75% of the variance in entire proxy reconstructions, Table 2).

We focus on changes over the past 1 to 2 millennia. We assess reconstructions and modeling studies analyzing a number of different climate fields, including atmospheric circulation diagnostics, precipitation, and drought. We devote particular attention to proxy-based reconstructions of temperature patterns in past centuries, which place recent large-scale warming in an appropriate longer-term context. Our assessment affirms the conclusion that late 20th century warmth is unprecedented at hemispheric and, likely, global scales. There is more tentative evidence that particular modes of climate variability, such as the El Nino/Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation, may have exhibited late 20th century behavior that is anomalous in a long-term context. Regional conclusions, particularly for the Southern Hemisphere and parts of the tropics where high-resolution proxy data are sparse, are more circumspect. The dramatic differences between regional and hemispheric/global past trends, and the distinction between changes in surface temperature and precipitation/drought fields, underscore the limited utility in the use of terms such as the “Little Ice Age” and “Medieval Warm Period” for describing past climate epochs during the last millennium. Comparison of empirical evidence with proxy-based reconstructions demonstrates that natural factors appear to explain relatively well the major surface temperature changes of the past millennium through the 19th century (including hemispheric means and some spatial patterns). Only anthropogenic forcing of climate, however, can explain the recent anomalous warming in the late 20th century."},{"id":1979440117,"microsoftAcademicId":1979440117,"doi":"10.1029/2005jd006548","title":"Uncertainty estimates in regional and global observed temperature changes: A new data set from 1850","authors":[{"LN":"Brohan","FN":"P.","affil":"Hadley Centre for Climate Prediction and Research"},{"LN":"Kennedy","FN":"J.

A new version of this data set, HadCRUT3, has been produced, benefiting from recent improvements to the sea surface temperature data set which forms its marine component, and from improvements to the station records which provide the land data. A comprehensive set of uncertainty estimates has been derived to accompany the data: Estimates of measurement and sampling error, temperature bias effects, and the effect of limited observational coverage on large-scale averages have all been made. Since the mid twentieth century the uncertainties in global and hemispheric mean temperatures are small, and the temperature increase greatly exceeds its uncertainty. In earlier periods the uncertainties are larger, but the temperature increase over the twentieth century is still significantly larger than its uncertainty."},{"id":1965358009,"microsoftAcademicId":1965358009,"doi":"10.1038/nature04679","title":"Climate sensitivity constrained by temperature reconstructions over the past seven centuries","authors":[{"LN":"Hegerl","FN":"Gabriele C.","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Crowley","FN":"Thomas J.","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Hyde","FN":"William T.","affil":"Duke University"},{"LN":"Frame","FN":"David J.","affil":"University of Oxford"}],"year":2006,"journal":"Nature","references":[1522296012,2046759075,2162204743,2127695985,2054167751,2052890963,2027745714,2028732731,2080002323,2042859974,2762086252,1978887368,2049890683,2142987884,2091813923,1618567178,1977244495,1506087782,2071364098,2015179509,2056393075,2149828401,2160926016,1652201389,2030573391,2019260572,2025402604,2911688879,2087902992,2142614493],"citationsCount":395,"abstract":"The scale of any future global warming will depend on the sensitivity of the climate system to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations.
