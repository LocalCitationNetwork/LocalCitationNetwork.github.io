First, we show that despite empirical psychologists’ nominal endorsement of a low rate of false-positive findings (≤ .05), flexibility in data collection, analysis, and reporting dramatically increases actual false-positive rates. In many cases, a researcher is more likely to falsely find evidence that an effect exists than to correctly find evidence that it does not. We present computer simulations and a pair of actual experiments that demonstrate how unacceptably easy it is to accumulate (and report) statistically significant evidence for a false hypothesis. Second, we suggest a simple, low-cost, and straightforwardly effective disclosure-based solution to this problem. The solution involves six concrete requirements for authors and four guidelines for reviewers, all of which impose a minimal burden on the publication process."},{"id":2144981148,"microsoftAcademicId":2144981148,"doi":"10.1371/journal.pmed.0020124","title":"Why Most Published Research Findings Are False","authors":[{"LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.

Large-scale evidence should be targeted for research questions where the pre-study probability is already considerably high, so that a significant research finding will lead to a post-test probability that would be considered quite definitive. Large-scale evidence is also particularly indicated when it can test major concepts rather than narrow, specific questions. A negative finding can then refute not only a specific proposed claim, but a whole field or considerable portion thereof. Selecting the performance of large-scale studies based on narrow-minded criteria, such as the marketing promotion of a specific drug, is largely wasted research.

The probability that a research claim is true may depend on study power and bias, the number of other studies on the same question, and, importantly, the ratio of true to no relationships among the relationships probed in each scientifi c fi eld. In this framework, a research fi nding is less likely to be true when the studies conducted in a fi eld are smaller; when effect sizes are smaller; when there is a greater number and lesser preselection of tested relationships; where there is greater fl exibility in designs, defi nitions, outcomes, and analytical modes; when there is greater fi nancial and other interest and prejudice; and when more teams are involved in a scientifi c fi eld in chase of statistical signifi cance. Simulations show that for most study designs and settings, it is more likely for a research claim to be false than true.

With estimates of the input parameters based on a questionnaire survey of a sample of social psychologists, the model output indicates a dysfunctional research-publication system.

During the transfer of projects from an academic to a company setting, the focus changes from ‘interesting’ to ‘feasible/marketable’, and the financial costs of pursuing a full-blown drug discovery and development programme for a particular target could ultimately be hundreds of millions of Euros. Even in the earlier stages, investments in activities such as high-throughput screening programmes are substantial, and thus the validity of published data on potential targets is crucial for companies when deciding to start novel projects. To mitigate some of the risks of such investments ultimately being wasted, most pharmaceutical companies run in-house target validation programmes.

When incentives favor novelty over replication, false results persist in the literature unchallenged, reducing efficiency in knowledge accumulation. Previous suggestions to address this problem are unlikely to be effective. For example, a journal of negative results publishes otherwise unpublishable reports. This enshrines the low status of the journal and its content. The persistence of false findings can be meliorated with strategies that make the fundamental but abstract accuracy motive—getting it right—competitive with the more tangible and concrete incentive—getting it published.

This order is intuitive and reflected in many features of academic life, but whether it reflects the “hardness” of scientific research—i.e., the extent to which research questions and results are determined by data and theories as opposed to non-cognitive factors—is controversial. This study analysed 2434 papers published in all disciplines and that declared to have tested a hypothesis. It was determined how many papers reported a “positive” (full or partial) or “negative” support for the tested hypothesis. If the hierarchy hypothesis is correct, then researchers in “softer” sciences should have fewer constraints to their conscious and unconscious biases, and therefore report more positive outcomes. Results confirmed the predictions at all levels considered: discipline, domain and methodology broadly defined. Controlling for observed differences between pure and applied disciplines, and between papers testing one or several hypotheses, the odds of reporting a positive result were around 5 times higher among papers in the disciplines of Psychology and Psychiatry and Economics and Business compared to Space Science, 2.3 times higher in the domain of social sciences compared to the physical sciences, and 3.4 times higher in studies applying behavioural and social methodologies on people compared to physical and chemical studies on non-biological material. In all comparisons, biological studies had intermediate values. These results suggest that the nature of hypotheses tested and the logical and methodological rigour employed to test them vary systematically across disciplines and fields, depending on the complexity of the subject matter and possibly other factors (e.g., a field's level of historical and/or intellectual development). On the other hand, these results support the scientific status of the social sciences against claims that they are completely subjective, by showing that, when they adopt a scientific approach to discovery, they differ from the natural sciences only by a matter of degree."},{"id":2128246772,"microsoftAcademicId":2128246772,"doi":"10.1016/j.tics.2014.02.010","title":"Publication and other reporting biases in cognitive sciences: detection, prevalence, and prevention","authors":[{"LN":"Ioannidis","FN":"John P.A."},{"LN":"Munafò","FN":"Marcus R."},{"LN":"Fusar-Poli","FN":"Paolo"},{"LN":"Nosek","FN":"Brian A."},{"LN":"David","FN":"Sean P."}],"year":2014,"journal":"Trends in Cognitive Sciences","references":[1987777080,2161498332,2105824687,2564042923,2116153150,2067833766,2091959199,2119605658,2033585778,2100267603,1690786713,2046391772,2065267852,2139598698,1981033874,2039418122,2134852288,2150215887,2080209500,1941783251,2002062153,2149893809,2164759539,2025471227,2097310500,2123263696,2053239079,2002030061,2021458971,2096656075,2103718021,1575893985,2144659346,1987673761,2005295476,1968886567,2006546769,2101872155,2073677120,2101083347,2143083982,2156110385,2117981173,2140382548,2168672683,2165828377,2013399300,2169662981,2093855897,2112039868,2040331591,2110476643,2098907700,2153627933,2086252264,2165176433,2127787997,2076224203,1991142512,2062631953,2001871336,2109462702,1975996475,2022160389,1993480036,2026056573,2056916538,1543699334,2109162089,2139542843,2037455308,1996865470,2476907122,2069224123,2116618538,2168599342,2080937370,2145118513,2028171536,2115494678,2065037887,2164524694,2145499755,2142922919,2315521453,1601856453,1831901831,1517830075,2980944224,2062908954],"citationsCount":268,"abstract":"Recent systematic reviews and empirical evaluations of the cognitive sciences literature suggest that publication and other reporting biases are prevalent across diverse domains of cognitive science.

To increase the reliability and accuracy of published papers, multiple changes have been proposed, such as changes in statistical methods. We support such reforms. However, we believe that the incentive structure of scientific publishing must change for such reforms to be successful. Under the current system, the quality of individual scientists is judged on the basis of their number of publications and citations, with journals similarly judged via numbers of citations. Neither of these measures takes into account the replicability of the published findings, as false or controversial results are often particularly widely cited. We propose tracking replications as a means of post-publication evaluation, both to help researchers identify reliable findings and to incentivize the publication of reliable results. Tracking replications requires a database linking published studies that replicate one another. As any such database is limited by the number of replication attempts published, we propose establishing an open-access journal dedicated to publishing replication attempts. Data quality of both the database and the affiliated journal would be ensured through a combination of crowd-sourcing and peer review. As reports in the database are aggregated, ultimately it will be possible to calculate replicability scores, which may be used alongside citation counts to evaluate the quality of work published in individual journals.

Most articles on effect sizes highlight their importance to communicate the practical significance of results. For scientists themselves, effect sizes are most useful because they facilitate cumulative science. Effect sizes can be used to determine the sample size for follow-up studies, or examining effects across studies. This article aims to provide a practical primer on how to calculate and report effect sizes for t-tests and ANOVA’s such that effect sizes can be used in a-priori power analyses and meta-analyses. Whereas many articles about effect sizes focus on between-subjects designs and address within-subjects designs only briefly, I provide a detailed overview of the similarities and differences between within- and between-subjects designs. I suggest that some research questions in experimental psychology examine inherently intra-individual effects, which makes effect sizes that incorporate the correlation between measures the best summary of the results.

Combined with the low power of most current work, this often leads to the use of misleading criteria about whether an effect has replicated. Rosenthal (1990) suggested more appropriate criteria, here labeled the continuously cumulating metaanalytic (CCMA) approach. For example, a CCMA analysis on a replication attempt that does not reach significance might nonetheless provide more, not less, evidence that the effect is real. Alternatively, measures of heterogeneity might show that two studies that differ in whether they are significant might have only trivially different effect sizes. We present a nontechnical introduction to the CCMA framework (referencing relevant software), and then explain how it can be used to address aspects of replicability or more generally to assess quantitative evidence from numerous studies. We then present some examples and simulation results using the CCMA approach that show how the combination of evidence can yield improved results over the consideration of single studies."},{"id":2292132415,"microsoftAcademicId":2292132415,"doi":"10.1111/j.1745-6924.2009.01151.x","title":"What Kind of Empirical Research Should We Publish, Fund, and Reward?: A Different Perspective","authors":[{"LN":"Rozin","FN":"Paul"}],"year":2009,"journal":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","references":[2158810025,2102770351,2030988365,2741340870,1725435973,2166232365,2100213394,2061131717,2101194318,2126466006,2019406391,1975762581,2019692889,2074481508],"citationsCount":105,"citationContext":{"1725435973":["To me, one of the most valuable and elegant contributions of thelast2decadesinsocialpsychologyistheworkontheculture of honor by  Nisbett and Cohen (1996) .\u001bThe rest of the impressive initial work on culture of honor ( Nisbett & Cohen, 1996 ) brought to bear the many sophistications and the ingenuity often exhibited, and beautifully developed, in experimental social psychological research.\u001b( Nisbett & Cohen, 1996,  offer a cultural-evolutionary account for the culture of honor in their book, but the work stands on its own as description of phenomena whether or not one subscribes to their theory.)

When it was first published in 1962, it was a landmark event in the history and philosophy of science. And fifty years later, it still has many lessons to teach. With \"The Structure of Scientific Revolutions\", Kuhn challenged long-standing linear notions of scientific progress, arguing that transformative ideas don't arise from the day-to-day, gradual process of experimentation and data accumulation, but that revolutions in science, those breakthrough moments that disrupt accepted thinking and offer unanticipated ideas, occur outside of \"normal science,\" as he called it. Though Kuhn was writing when physics ruled the sciences, his ideas on how scientific revolutions bring order to the anomalies that amass over time in research experiments are still instructive in our biotech age. This new edition of Kuhn's essential work in the history of science includes an insightful introductory essay by Ian Hacking that clarifies terms popularized by Kuhn, including paradigm and incommensurability, and applies Kuhn's ideas to the science of today. Usefully keyed to the separate sections of the book, Hacking's essay provides important background information as well as a contemporary context. Newly designed, with an expanded index, this edition will be eagerly welcomed by the next generation of readers seeking to understand the history of our perspectives on science."},{"id":2123263696,"microsoftAcademicId":2123263696,"doi":"10.1177/1745691612463078","title":"An Agenda for Purely Confirmatory Research","authors":[{"LN":"Wagenmakers","FN":"Eric-Jan"},{"LN":"Wetzels","FN":"Ruud"},{"LN":"Borsboom","FN":"Denny"},{"LN":"Maas","FN":"Han L.

It then becomes tempting to fine tune the analysis to the data in order to obtain a desired result—a procedure that invalidates the interpretation of the common statistical tests. The extent of the fine tuning varies widely across experiments and experimenters but is almost impossible for reviewers and readers to gauge. To remedy the situation, we propose that researchers preregister their studies and indicate in advance the analyses they intend to conduct. Only these analyses deserve the label “confirmatory,” and only for these analyses are the common statistical tests valid. Other analyses can be carried out but these should be labeled “exploratory.” We illustrate our proposal with a confirmatory replication attempt of a study on extrasensory perception."},{"id":1987673761,"microsoftAcademicId":1987673761,"doi":"10.1177/1745691612460688","title":"Replications in psychology research: How often do they really occur?","authors":[{"LN":"Makel","FN":"Matthew C."},{"LN":"Plucker","FN":"Jonathan A."},{"LN":"Hegarty","FN":"Boyd"}],"year":2012,"journal":"Perspectives on Psychological Science","references":[2144981148,2037124948,2118699776,2080209500,2169244873,2018443796,2021458971,2094419105,2019866696,2032866148,2165719008,1979863478,2042930386,2596562148,2002955157,2018318609,2167037159,2165944832,2945393134,1977602123,2035742891,2067566126,2127216477,2083435216,2412035472],"citationsCount":507,"citationContext":{"2094419105":["Just as Campbell and Stanley (1963) cautioned against considering experimental methods as a panacea, all replications are not of equal value."],"2165944832":["Lykken (1968) noted that, as researchers, “we are interested in the construct ."],"2167037159":["Currently, the system used to determine what studies merit replication is, as Hunt (1975) somewhat generously described, “informal and somewhat haphazard and could be improved” (p."],"2412035472":["The first use of the term replication that we found in a psychology journal was Rosenblith’s article (1949) in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, titled “A Replication of Some Roots of Prejudice,” which successfully replicated the findings of Allport and Kramer (1946) while relying on college students in South Dakota instead of those in Harvard, Radcliffe, and Dartmouth."],"2596562148":["The first use of the term replication that we found in a psychology journal was Rosenblith’s article (1949) in the Journal of Abnormal Psychology, titled “A Replication of Some Roots of Prejudice,” which successfully replicated the findings of Allport and Kramer (1946) while relying on college students in South Dakota instead of those in Harvard, Radcliffe, and Dartmouth.","The recent publication of a controversial study on extrasensory perception (Bem, 2011) along with a few well-publicized fraud cases have catalyzed a healthy conversation within the psychological research community about the process used to publish research (e.g., Carpenter, 2012; Crocker & Cooper, 2011; Roediger, 2012; Wagenmakers, Wetzels, Borsboom, & van der Mass, 2011; but cf.

In this paper, we argue that prevention science will be better positioned to help improve public health if (a) more replications are conducted; (b) those replications are systematic, thoughtful, and conducted with full knowledge of the trials that have preceded them; and (c) state-of-the art techniques are used to summarize the body of evidence on the effects of the interventions. Under real-world demands it is often not feasible to wait for multiple replications to accumulate before making decisions about intervention adoption. To help individuals and agencies make better decisions about intervention utility, we outline strategies that can be used to help understand the likely direction, size, and range of intervention effects as suggested by the current knowledge base. We also suggest structural changes that could increase the amount and quality of replication research, such as the provision of incentives and a more vigorous pursuit of prospective research registers. Finally, we discuss methods for integrating replications into the roll-out of a program and suggest that strong partnerships with local decision makers are a key component of success in replication research. Our hope is that this paper can highlight the importance of replication and stimulate more discussion of the important elements of the replication process.

Bacteria can integrate short stretches of phage-derived sequences (spacers) within CRISPR loci to become phage resistant. In this study, we further characterized the efficiency of CRISPR1 as a phage resistance mechanism in Streptococcus thermophilus. First, we show that CRISPR1 is distinct from previously known phage defense systems and is effective against the two main groups of S. thermophilus phages. Analyses of 30 bacteriophage-insensitive mutants of S. thermophilus indicate that the addition of one new spacer in CRISPR1 is the most frequent outcome of a phage challenge and that the iterative addition of spacers increases the overall phage resistance of the host. The added new spacers have a size of between 29 to 31 nucleotides, with 30 being by far the most frequent. Comparative analysis of 39 newly acquired spacers with the complete genomic sequences of the wild-type phages 2972, 858, and DT1 demonstrated that the newly added spacer must be identical to a region (named proto-spacer) in the phage genome to confer a phage resistance phenotype. Moreover, we found a CRISPR1-specific sequence (NNAGAAW) located downstream of the proto-spacer region that is important for the phage resistance phenotype.

Moreover, it has been demonstrated that such interference is based on small RNAs carrying a spacer. These RNAs would guide the defence apparatus to foreign molecules carrying sequences that match the spacers. Despite this essential role, the spacer uptake mechanism has not been addressed.

Combining several repeats with different amino acids in the hypervariable positions allowed the production of new effectors that targeted new DNA sites.\n\n [1]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1183604\n [2]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1178817\n [3]: /lookup/doi/10.1126/science.1178811"},{"id":2073873559,"microsoftAcademicId":2073873559,"doi":"10.1126/science.1178817","title":"A Simple Cipher Governs DNA Recognition by TAL Effectors","authors":[{"LN":"Moscou","FN":"Matthew J."},{"LN":"Bogdanove","FN":"Adam J."}],"year":2009,"journal":"Science","references":[1987188990,2050757906,2080315424,2117956345,1999843211,2119400422],"citationsCount":1874,"abstract":"TAL effectors of plant pathogenic bacteria in the genus Xanthomonas bind host DNA and activate genes that contribute to disease or turn on defense.

However, creation of a DNA double-stranded break (DSB) in the genomic target (DSB-GT) can stimulate homologous recombination by over 1000-fold (4). \r\n\r\nWe can rapidly and quantitatively measure gene targeting by correcting a mutation in a green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene that has been stably integrated into the genome (5) (fig. S1). With an optimized GFP gene targeting system, the introduction of a DSB by I–Sce I (Sce) stimulated GT >40,000-fold and the absolute rate of gene targeting reached 3 to 5% (fig. S2). Such a system, however, depends on the prior introduction of a Sce binding site into the target gene and cannot be used for endogenous genes. Chimeric nucleases (CNs) have the potential to create sequence-specific DSBs (6). CNs—fusions between zinc finger binding DNA binding domains and the endonuclease domain of Fok I—can sitespecifically cleave naked DNA in vitro (6), extrachromosomal DNA in Xenopus oocytes (7), and chromosomal DNA in Drosophila (8). CNs work as dimers, and their efficiency depends on the spacing and orientation of the zinc finger binding sites with respect to the length of the amino acid linker between the DNA binding and endonuclease domains (7, 9). \r\n\r\nQQR is an artificial zinc finger DNA binding domain that recognizes the sequence 5′-GGGGAAGAA-3′ with nanomolar affinity (10). We modified QQR chimeric nucleases (QQR-CNs) (7, 9) (Fig. 1A) and tested whether they stimulated gene targeting (Fig. 1B). The background rate of gene targeting was 0.71 events per million transfected cells (fig. S1C). QQRL18-CN stimulated gene targeting 17-fold on target QQR6 and 260-fold on target QQR8 (Fig. 1B). QQRL0-CN did not stimulate gene targeting on target QQR8, but it was as efficient as Sce in stimulating gene targeting by over 2000-fold on target QQR6 (Fig. 1B). QQRL18-CN showed some preference for an 8–base pair (bp) spacing between binding sites whereas QQRL0-CN preferred 6-bp spacing. Thus, removing the linker between the zinc spacfinger and the nuclease domains increased the activity and specificity of the fusion protein in mammalian cells. As controls, we showed that the CNs did not stimulate gene targeting if (i) they lacked a nuclear localization signal, (ii) there was a single binding site rather than an inverted repeat binding site in the target, and (iii) the cognate binding site was changed. Thus, homodimers of CNs are potent stimulators of gene targeting in human somatic cells."},{"id":2025074364,"microsoftAcademicId":2025074364,"doi":"10.1038/nbt.1755","title":"A TALE nuclease architecture for efficient genome editing","authors":[{"LN":"Miller","FN":"Jeffrey C"},{"LN":"Tan","FN":"Siyuan"},{"LN":"Qiao","FN":"Guijuan"},{"LN":"Barlow","FN":"Kyle A"},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Jianbin"},{"LN":"Xia","FN":"Danny F"},{"LN":"Meng","FN":"Xiangdong"},{"LN":"Paschon","FN":"David E"},{"LN":"Leung","FN":"Elo"},{"LN":"Hinkley","FN":"Sarah J"},{"LN":"Dulay","FN":"Gladys P"},{"LN":"Hua","FN":"Kevin L"},{"LN":"Ankoudinova","FN":"Irina"},{"LN":"Cost","FN":"Gregory J"},{"LN":"Urnov","FN":"Fyodor D"},{"LN":"Zhang","FN":"H Steve"},{"LN":"Holmes","FN":"Michael C"},{"LN":"Zhang","FN":"Lei"},{"LN":"Gregory","FN":"Philip D"},{"LN":"Rebar","FN":"Edward J"}],"year":2011,"journal":"Nature Biotechnology","references":[1978129709,1982969769,2073873559,2112006537,2009626008,2110260408,2096136751,2090630729,2116565356,2036632122,2150798416,1967999689,2130931930,137643597,1980449150,2039316426,1968140045,2143208261,2051395442,2099106733,1987188990,2050757906,2008784634,1906155566,2093050056,2029425876,2091708974,2099067892,2078308455,1965018476,2136364313,2136544377,2061940955,1997060995,2009043217,2037335353,2114820987,2055125531,2023895619,2101027021,1750064874,2037477793,2171050607,1503979586,1496896647,2107812654,2168213733,2147164622,2065136593,1979388919,2103733680,1982880630],"citationsCount":1984,"citationContext":{"1496896647":["By design, the recovered clones lacked codons for their first 152 residues, as this region specifies transport into plant cells and is dispensable for other function"],"1750064874":["Moreover, Sanger sequencing of the resultant amplicons identified 7 mutated alleles out of 84 analyzed and also revealed a mutation spectrum (minor deletions) consistent with error-prone break repair by means of nonhomologous end joinin"],"1978129709":["Recently, two groups described an approach for engineering DNA-binding specificities based upon TALEs from  Xanthomonas  plant pathogen"],"1997060995":["To date, such methods have been demonstrated in at least nine species that previously lacked effective genome engineering strategie"],"2009043217":["TALENs were also shown to induce NHEJ-mediated capture of an oligonucleotide duplex at the endogenous  NTF3  locus in K562 cell"],"2029425876":["1b ) and an alternative—NK—that we tested for recognition of guanin"],"2037335353":["Our target for these studies was the human  NTF3  gene, which encodes a secreted nerve growth factor that has therapeutic potential for neurodegenerative disease"],"2037477793":[", a setting that does not necessarily predict function on endogenous genes in more complex genome"],"2039316426":["These results have spurred interest in the potential use of TALE-nuclease chimeras (TALENs"],"2055125531":["This increased to 9% when the TALEN-transfected cells were subjected to transient hypothermi"],"2073873559":["Recently, two groups described an approach for engineering DNA-binding specificities based upon TALEs from  Xanthomonas  plant pathogen"],"2078308455":["The targeting of the resulting zinc finger nuclease (ZFN), which cleaves as a dimer, is mediated by its linked ZFP domai"],"2090630729":["Efficient modification by NHEJ and homology directed repair (HDR)    To gauge the generality of this result, we sought to demonstrate TALEN-mediated gene modification at an additional locus: the site of the Δ32 deletion within the human  CCR5  gen"],"2096136751":["Moreover, cleavage-based genome engineering methods are portable to diverse cell types and species as the requisite repair pathways are highly conserve"],"2099067892":["This capability may find use in a range of researc"],"2110260408":["The therapeutic implications of such capabilities have been note"],"2114820987":["To date, such methods have been demonstrated in at least nine species that previously lacked effective genome engineering strategie"],"2116565356":["When TALENs were expressed at 37 °C (our standard conditions) we observed up to 3% modification as measured by the Surveyor assa"],"2136364313":["A DNA fragment encoding the TALE repeat domain of NT-L was generated by PCR-based gene synthesis as describe"],"2136544377":["However, the activities fall short of several ZFN pair"],"2150798416":[", a setting that does not necessarily predict function on endogenous genes in more complex genome"],"2171050607":["Transcriptional repression has provided a strategy for reducing the activity of classically nondruggable gene target"]},"abstract":"TALEs (transcription activator-like effectors) are transcription factors from the plant pathogen Xanthomonas that can be readily engineered to bind new DNA sequences of interest.

The cleavage event is induced using two custom-designed ZFNs that heterodimerize upon binding DNA to form a catalytically active nuclease complex. Using the current ZFN architecture, however, cleavage-competent homodimers may also form that can limit safety or efficacy via off-target cleavage. Here we develop an improved ZFN architecture that eliminates this problem. Using structure-based design, we engineer two variant ZFNs that efficiently cleave DNA only when paired as a heterodimer. These ZFNs modify a native endogenous locus as efficiently as the parental architecture, but with a >40-fold reduction in homodimer function and much lower levels of genome-wide cleavage. This architecture provides a general means for improving the specificity of ZFNs as gene modification reagents."},{"id":2023186109,"microsoftAcademicId":2023186109,"doi":"10.1038/nature07755","title":"A three-dimensional view of the molecular machinery of RNA interference","authors":[{"LN":"Jinek","FN":"Martin"},{"LN":"Doudna","FN":"Jennifer A."}],"year":2009,"journal":"Nature","references":[2083381199,1611419331,2163199119,2117991391,2152993806,1980269624,2109136664,2050066317,2082213106,2139871850,1982944995,1976342457,2101543035,2055309264,2096018896,2045402423,2135837360,2015858554,2066213138,2074106269,2082997857,2010791234,2099517697,2158010566,2035340311,1971549481,2156629568,2119015197,2141729181,2131957545,2095509700,2152869747,2102694589,2131246621,1984109071,1980207862,2058982772,2024316824,1968948510,1970679679,2122889796,2024725357,2111831519,1976840413,2057906056,2126417923,2122078080,2105068295,2019749608,2054166086,2041237942,2064667228,2159638567,2049392988,2136177706,2161560970,2041594569,2146180278,2118818674,2043254922,2163298186,2066173314,2074775898,2120967544,1994873854,1965854786,2066035587,2092758029,2135066895,2125489084,2034235936,2003024383,1996830006,2062290881,1988249075,2158605421,2116603538,2143355329,2030239964,1987154973,2072958095,2028466333,1971279688,2025988532,2004445056,1970769181,1985863431,2017866593,2128880038,2021414543,2137519022,2164257867],"citationsCount":767,"citationContext":{"1968948510":["The two signature domains of the Argonaute family — the PAZ domain and the C-terminal PIWI domain — were originally identified by phylogenetic sequence analysi"],"1970679679":["Biochemical studies suggest that, similarly to RNaseH, prokaryotic Argonaute proteins function as DNA-guided ribonuclease"],"1971279688":["Similar analysis of  Schizosaccharomyces pombe  (fission yeast) Ago1, a component of the RITS, showed that its slicer activity is required for transcriptional silencin"],"1976342457":["The PIWI clade of the Argonaute protein family is thought to use slicing in piRNA-mediated silencing of mobile genetic elements in the germ lin"],"1976840413":["melanogaster , the interaction between Argonaute proteins and the P-body protein GW182 is required for miRNA-mediated repression of mRNAs, as well as for Argonaute localizatio"],"1980207862":["The PAZ domain of Dicer has the same fold and 3′-overhang-binding residues as the PAZ domain of Argonaute proteins (discussed in the next section"],"1980269624":["The hairpin region is excised from the pri-miRNA in the nucleus by the endonuclease Drosh"],"1982944995":["Two features of siRNAs and miRNAs ensure that they are efficiently incorporated into the RISC: the length of the duplex;

These enzymes initiate transfer of those elements (and themselves) by generating strand breaks in cognate alleles that lack the intervening sequence, as well as in additional ectopic sites that broaden the range of intron and intein mobility. Homing endonucleases can be divided into several unique families that are remarkable in several respects: they display extremely high DNA-binding specificities which arise from long DNA target sites (14-40 bp), they are tolerant of a variety of sequence variations in these sites, and they display disparate DNA cleavage mechanisms. A significant number of homing endonucleases also act as maturases (highly specific cofactors for the RNA splicing reactions of their cognate introns). Of the known homing group I endonuclease families, two (HNH and His-Cys box enzymes) appear to be diverged from a common ancestral nuclease. While crystal structures of several representatives of the LAGLIDADG endonuclease family have been determined, only structures of single members of the HNH (I-HmuI), His-Cys box (I-PpoI) and GIY-YIG (I-TevI) families have been elucidated. These studies provide an important source of information for structure-function relationships in those families, and are the centerpiece of this review.

infections and plasmid transformations. One defense system recently described in these organisms is the CRISPR-Cas system (Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats loci coupled to CRISPR-associated genes). Two S. thermophilus CRISPR-Cas systems, CRISPR1-Cas and CRISPR3-Cas, have been shown to actively block phage infection. The CRISPR1-Cas system interferes by cleaving foreign dsDNA entering the cell in a length-specific and orientation-dependant manner. Here, we show that the S. thermophilus CRISPR3-Cas system acts by cleaving phage dsDNA genomes at the same specific position inside the targeted protospacer as observed with the CRISPR1-Cas system. Only one cleavage site was observed in all tested strains. Moreover, we observed that the CRISPR1-Cas and CRISPR3-Cas systems are compatible and, when both systems are present within the same cell, provide increased resistance against phage infection by both cleaving the invading dsDNA. We also determined that overall phage resistance efficiency is correlated to the total number of newly acquired spacers in both CRISPR

This family is characterized by direct repeats, varying in size from 21 to 37 bp, interspaced by similarly sized non-repetitive sequences. To appreciate their characteri-stic structure, we will refer to this family as the clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR). In most species with two or more CRISPR loci, these loci were flanked on one side by a common leader sequence of 300–500 b. The direct repeats and the leader sequences were conserved within a species, but dissimilar between species. The presence of multiple chromosomal CRISPR loci suggests that CRISPRs are mobile elements. Four CRISPR-associated (cas) genes were identified in CRISPR-containing prokaryotes that were absent from CRISPR-negative prokaryotes. The cas genes were invariably located adjacent to a CRISPR locus, indicating that the cas genes and CRISPR loci have a functional relationship. The cas3 gene showed motifs characteristic for helicases of the superfamily 2, and the cas4 gene showed motifs of the RecB family of exonucleases, suggesting that these genes are involved in DNA metabolism or gene expression.

Sequence analysis of CRISPR structures from 24 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus and Streptococcus vestibularis confirmed the homology of spacers with extrachromosomal elements. Phage sensitivity of S. thermophilus strains appears to be correlated with the number of spacers in the CRISPR locus the strain carries. The authors suggest that the spacer elements are the traces of past invasions by extrachromosomal elements, and hypothesize that they provide the cell immunity against phage infection, and more generally foreign DNA expression, by coding an anti-sense RNA.

Here, we characterize a novel Streptococcus thermophilus locus, CRISPR3, and experimentally demonstrate its ability to integrate novel spacers in response to bacteriophage. Also, we analyze CRISPR diversity and activity across three distinct CRISPR loci in several S. thermophilus strains. We show that both CRISPR repeats and cas genes are locus specific and functionally coupled. A total of 124 strains were studied, and 109 unique spacer arrangements were observed across the three CRISPR loci. Overall, 3,626 spacers were analyzed, including 2,829 for CRISPR1 (782 unique), 173 for CRISPR2 (16 unique), and 624 for CRISPR3 (154 unique). Sequence analysis of the spacers revealed homology and identity to phage sequences (77%), plasmid sequences (16%), and S. thermophilus chromosomal sequences (7%). Polymorphisms were observed for the CRISPR repeats, CRISPR spacers, cas genes, CRISPR motif, locus architecture, and specific sequence content. Interestingly, CRISPR loci evolved both via polarized addition of novel spacers after exposure to foreign genetic elements and via internal deletion of spacers. We hypothesize that the level of diversity is correlated with relative CRISPR activity and propose that the activity is highest for CRISPR1, followed by CRISPR3, while CRISPR2 may be degenerate. Globally, the dynamic nature of CRISPR loci might prove valuable for typing and comparative analyses of strains and microbial populations.

Repeats of 21–37 bp typically show weak dyad symmetry and are separated by regularly sized, nonrepetitive spacer sequences. Four CRISPR-associated (Cas) protein families, designated Cas1 to Cas4, are strictly associated with CRISPR elements and always occur near a repeat cluster. Some spacers originate from mobile genetic elements and are thought to confer “immunity” against the elements that harbor these sequences. In the present study, we have systematically investigated uncharacterized proteins encoded in the vicinity of these CRISPRs and found many additional protein families that are strictly associated with CRISPR loci across multiple prokaryotic species. Multiple sequence alignments and hidden Markov models have been built for 45 Cas protein families. These models identify family members with high sensitivity and selectivity and classify key regulators of development, DevR and DevS, in Myxococcus xanthus as Cas proteins. These identifications show that CRISPR/cas gene regions can be quite large, with up to 20 different, tandem-arranged cas genes next to a repeat cluster or filling the region between two repeat clusters. Distinctive subsets of the collection of Cas proteins recur in phylogenetically distant species and correlate with characteristic repeat periodicity. The analyses presented here support initial proposals of mobility of these units, along with the likelihood that loci of different subtypes interact with one another as well as with host cell defensive, replicative, and regulatory systems. It is evident from this analysis that CRISPR/cas loci are larger, more complex, and more heterogeneous than previously appreciated."},{"id":1977531433,"microsoftAcademicId":1977531433,"doi":"10.1101/gad.1742908","title":"Cas6 is an endoribonuclease that generates guide RNAs for invader defense in prokaryotes","authors":[{"LN":"Carte","FN":"Jason"},{"LN":"Wang","FN":"Ruiying"},{"LN":"Li","FN":"Hong"},{"LN":"Terns","FN":"Rebecca M."},{"LN":"Terns","FN":"Michael P."}],"year":2008,"journal":"Genes & Development","references":[2144081223,1995017064,1986191025,2038840577,2169244146,2010986636,1965277349,2135598273,2123965484,1986171241,1990487336,2153355254,2077190448,2166139447,2168933209,2159746639,1965404910,2108101601,1995867192,2007153971,2085436536,2067853474,2100226515,1528632786,2057964816,2154186763,2139544568,1978542189,2092758029,2162900837,1953646178,2163184595,1933777541,2117316548,1993838942,2126634558],"citationsCount":549,"citationContext":{"1528632786":["Most notably, PfCas6 lacks the prevalent aromatic and positive residues that characterize the -sheets of RRMs (Maris et al. 2005).","The ferredoxin fold is a common protein fold also found in the structures of other RNA-binding proteins including the well-characterized RNA recognition motif (RRM), which primarily functions in ssRNA binding (Maris et al. 2005)."],"1933777541":["The electrostatic potential was computed using the GRASP2 program (Petrey and Honig 2003) and is colored red and blue, for negative and positive potentials, respectively."],"1953646178":["Additional studies may reveal if Cas6 is also an important component of pRNAi effector complexes (serving to couple biogenesis and function), as is the case for eukaryotic Dicer enzymes (Jaskiewicz and Filipowicz 2008).","Cas6 is evolutionarily, structurally, and catalytically distinct from the Dicer proteins that function in the release of individual RNAs that mediate gene silencing in eukaryotes (Hammond 2005;

In particular, we find that the coldest epoch of the last millennium—the putative Little Ice Age—is most likely to have experienced the coldest temperatures during the fifteenth century in the central and eastern Pacific Ocean, during the seventeenth century in northwestern Europe and southeastern North America, and during the mid-nineteenth century over most of the remaining regions. Furthermore, the spatial coherence that does exist over the preindustrial Common Era is consistent with the spatial coherence of stochastic climatic variability. This lack of spatiotemporal coherence indicates that preindustrial forcing was not sufficient to produce globally synchronous extreme temperatures at multidecadal and centennial timescales. By contrast, we find that the warmest period of the past two millennia occurred during the twentieth century for more than 98 per cent of the globe. This provides strong evidence that anthropogenic global warming is not only unparalleled in terms of absolute temperatures5, but also unprecedented in spatial consistency within the context of the past 2,000 years."},"input":[{"id":2151746416,"microsoftAcademicId":2151746416,"doi":"10.1073/pnas.0805721105","title":"Proxy-based reconstructions of hemispheric and global surface temperature variations over the past two millennia","authors":[{"LN":"Mann","FN":"Michael E."},{"LN":"Zhang","FN":"Zhihua"},{"LN":"Hughes","FN":"Malcolm K."},{"LN":"Bradley","FN":"Raymond S."},{"LN":"Miller","FN":"Sonya K."},{"LN":"Rutherford","FN":"Scott"},{"LN":"Ni","FN":"Fenbiao"}],"year":2008,"journal":"Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America","references":[2939474406,1979440117,2070257026,1660201747,2131532072,2103095238,2054167751,2027745714,2011526969,2146079950,2126147651,2176233088,2042859974,2074964089,2174160981,1965358009,1978887368,2340356055,1993341938,1978291154,1907038160,2062457444,2148200724,2007377949,2043831111,2003326514,2916771639,2008693787,2169277953,1994800218,2077617098,1582709791,2056453952,2019728218,2098654378,2139223514,2142967805,1577685107,2056557542,2064908013,1989058095,2111874475],"citationsCount":1073,"abstract":"Following the suggestions of a recent National Research Council report [NRC (National Research Council) (2006) Surface Temperature Reconstructions for the Last 2,000 Years (Natl Acad Press, Washington, DC).], we reconstruct surface temperature at hemispheric and global scale for much of the last 2,000 years using a greatly expanded set of proxy data for decadal-to-centennial climate changes, recently updated instrumental data, and complementary methods that have been thoroughly tested and validated with model simulation experiments. Our results extend previous conclusions that recent Northern Hemisphere surface temperature increases are likely anomalous in a long-term context. Recent warmth appears anomalous for at least the past 1,300 years whether or not tree-ring data are used. If tree-ring data are used, the conclusion can be extended to at least the past 1,700 years, but with additional strong caveats. The reconstructed amplitude of change over past centuries is greater than hitherto reported, with somewhat greater Medieval warmth in the Northern Hemisphere, albeit still not reaching recent levels."},{"id":2142987884,"microsoftAcademicId":2142987884,"doi":"10.1126/science.1096109","title":"Reconstructing past climate from noisy data","authors":[{"LN":"Storch","FN":"Hans von"},{"LN":"Zorita","FN":"Eduardo"},{"LN":"Jones","FN":"Julie M."},{"LN":"Dimitriev","FN":"Yegor"},{"LN":"González-Rouco","FN":"Fidel"},{"LN":"Tett","FN":"Simon F.

The review is in three parts: the principal high-resolution proxy disciplines (trees, corals, ice cores and documentary evidence), emphasizing current issues in their use for climate reconstruction; the various approaches that have been adopted to combine multiple climate proxy records to provide estimates of past annual-to-decadal timescale Northern Hemisphere surface temperatures and other climate variables, such as large-scale circulation indices; and the forcing histories used in climate model simulations of the past millennium. We discuss the need to develop a framework through which current and new approaches to interpreting these proxy data may be rigorously assessed using pseudo-proxies derived from climate model runs, where the `answer' is known. The article concludes with a list of recommendations. First, more raw proxy data are required from the diverse disciplines and from more locations, as well as replication, for all proxy sources, of the basic raw measurements to improve absolute dating, and to better distinguish the proxy climate signal from noise. Second, more effort is required to improve the understanding of what individual proxies respond to, supported by more site measurements and process studies. These activities should also be mindful of the correlation structure of instrumental data, indicating which adjacent proxy records ought to be in agreement and which not. Third, large-scale climate reconstructions should be attempted using a wide variety of techniques, emphasizing those for which quantified errors can be estimated at specified timescales. Fourth, a greater use of climate model simulations is needed to guide the choice of reconstruction techniques (the pseudo-proxy concept) and possibly help determine where, given limited resources, future sampling should be concentrated."},{"id":2108531121,"microsoftAcademicId":2108531121,"doi":"10.1126/science.1177303","title":"Global Signatures and Dynamical Origins of the Little Ice Age and Medieval Climate Anomaly","authors":[{"LN":"Mann","FN":"Michael E."},{"LN":"Zhang","FN":"Zhihua"},{"LN":"Rutherford","FN":"Scott"},{"LN":"Bradley","FN":"Raymond S."},{"LN":"Hughes","FN":"Malcolm K."},{"LN":"Shindell","FN":"Drew"},{"LN":"Ammann","FN":"Caspar"},{"LN":"Faluvegi","FN":"Greg"},{"LN":"Ni","FN":"Fenbiao"}],"year":2009,"journal":"Science","references":[2939474406,2907110490,1979440117,2093401535,2070257026,1660201747,2131532072,2151746416,2011526969,2146079950,2034795620,2038669354,1978887368,1993341938,1982725147,1907038160,2070398649,2097872776,2012516451,2043831111,2003326514,2175816372,2169074850,2141077951,2173880861,1999037513,2161680946,1965018909,2139223514],"citationsCount":1576,"abstract":"Global temperatures are known to have varied over the past 1500 years, but the spatial patterns have remained poorly defined.

At multi-decadal to centennial scales, temperature variability shows distinctly different regional patterns, with more similarity within each hemisphere than between them. There were no globally synchronous multi-decadal warm or cold intervals that define a worldwide Medieval Warm Period or Little Ice Age, but all reconstructions show generally cold conditions between ad 1580 and 1880, punctuated in some regions by warm decades during the eighteenth century. The transition to these colder conditions occurred earlier in the Arctic, Europe and Asia than in North America or the Southern Hemisphere regions. Recent warming reversed the long-term cooling; during the period ad 1971–2000, the area-weighted average reconstructed temperature was higher than any other time in nearly 1,400 years."},{"id":2105942117,"microsoftAcademicId":2105942117,"doi":"10.1002/joc.3370140404","title":"SPATIAL REGRESSION METHODS IN DENDROCLIMATOLOGY: A REVIEW AND COMPARISON OF TWO TECHNIQUES","authors":[{"LN":"Cook","FN":"Edward R."},{"LN":"Briffa","FN":"Keith R."},{"LN":"Jones","FN":"Philip D."}],"year":1994,"journal":"International Journal of Climatology","references":[2064142190,1993196883,2033904036,1981256179,1529972356,1981381864,1989872308,2160172778,1577685107,2085655266,2075007695,2085297375,1995862475,1982864447,2023151740,2174577859,2014185544,1656882770,2029670837,1993424561,2071258578,2444456673,2087702973,2000432226,2088494568,2333941540,181764242,40849163,1983616018,198971112,2915112861,2153412629,2149323977,2107836296,2037414600,2079453955,2174400750,40820063,2080331419,2144571184,2052036660,2026202948,2203908052,2007787896,2005876726],"citationsCount":471,"abstract":"We review and compare two alternative spatial regression methods used in dendroclimatology to reconstruct climate from tree rings. These methods are orthogonal spatial regression (OSR) and canonical regression (CR). Both the OSR and CR methods have a common foundation in least-squares theory and converge to the same solution when all p candidate tree-ring predictors of climate are forced into the model. However, the perfomance of OSR and CR may differ when only subsets p' < p predictors are used. Theory cannot predict how either method is likely to perform when best-subset selection is applied, especially with regards to reconstruction accuracy. Consequently, empirical comparisons of OSR and CR are made using three tree-ring and climate networks from western Europe and eastern North America that have been used in previous dendroclimatic studies. These comparisons rely on a suite of regression model verification statistics to validate the accuracy of the climatic reconstructions produced by the best-subset models. The results indicate little real difference between OSR and CR, with each performing equally good or bad depending on the amount of recoverable climatic information in the tree rings. Canonical regression may perform slightly better in high signal-to-noise cases; conversely, OSR may perform slightly better when the signal-to-noise ratio is low. None of these apparent differences are large enough to select one method in preference to the other, however, and many more comparisons would be needed to determine if such indications are generally valid."},{"id":2070257026,"microsoftAcademicId":2070257026,"doi":"10.1126/science.1093877","title":"European Seasonal and Annual Temperature Variability, Trends, and Extremes Since 1500","authors":[{"LN":"Luterbacher","FN":"Jürg"},{"LN":"Dietrich","FN":"Daniel"},{"LN":"Xoplaki","FN":"Elena"},{"LN":"Grosjean","FN":"Martin"},{"LN":"Wanner","FN":"Heinz"}],"year":2004,"journal":"Science","references":[2166163519,2008668438,1978601068,2133488074,1660201747,2131532072,2130256070,2027745714,2029688250,2041875607,2014236192,2122809335,2074964089,1978887368,1963650928,1993341938,2043514774,2115183951,2148200724,2007377949,2146937853,2181097193,1898890511,2175805510,2105942117,2173880861,2141729885,1618184752,1537214629,1496733290,2014944844,220666396,2064908013,2056622109,2075377641,2612714301,19410568,2043474973,125086599],"citationsCount":1679,"citationContext":{"1537214629":["Station/Region Latitude Longitude Years Missing Sources Germany Southern 1500–1658 None ( 1 ) Switzerland Swiss Plateau 1500–1658 None (2,3)\u001b( 1 ) R.

Besides the longterm experiments, CMIP5 calls for an entirely new suite of “near term” simulations focusing on recent decades..."},{"id":2050413070,"microsoftAcademicId":2050413070,"doi":"10.1007/s10584-007-9276-x","title":"The importance of the geophysical context in statistical evaluations of climate reconstruction procedures","authors":[{"LN":"Ammann","FN":"Caspar M."},{"LN":"Wahl","FN":"Eugene R."}],"year":2007,"journal":"Climatic Change","references":[2939474406,1522296012,2070257026,1660201747,2131532072,2130256070,2103095238,2054167751,2103651007,2151571592,2174160981,2038669354,1978887368,2111948917,2142987884,2136350156,1982725147,2171612194,2180677008,2097872776,2123539718,2012516451,1996896637,2122112067,2176588269,2060208241,1968257597,2043831111,1974992986,2003326514,2916771639,2335780408,2061607134,2181097193,2169074850,2008693787,2164897769,2059738590,2127582060,2058641882,1989061310,1994800218,2119406349,2161917327,2149828401,2070092732,2111485892,2098654378,2026603628,2139223514,2142967805,2066165799,74243001,2180301600,2025336675,1548329103,2107602834,1977178596,200810345,1989997544,2796307220,1984232315,2141430304,2099285484,1987484552,1640223595,98755047],"citationsCount":101,"citationContext":{"98755047":["These climate field reconstructions (CFRs) not only provide information over regions where direct proxy data are available, but they can make use of the fact that the climate system anomalies can be projected onto a relatively small set of principal modes of variability (Kaplan et al. 1997; Mann et al. 1998; Corti et al. 1999;  Palmer 1999;  Stephenson et al. 2004)."],"200810345":["In this process, it will be important to further refine the reconstructions and to resolve seasonal rather than only annual variations (Mann et al. 2000; Luterbacher et al. 2004; Xoplaki et al. 2005), and as the data density increases one can even approach expansion to non-","This advantage has proven particularly interesting for the study of variations in some of the climate modes with global significance, such as ENSO (Mann et al. 2000) or the NAO (Cook et al."],"1660201747":["comparison results reported by Mann et al.

Here, we reflect on what can be learned from recent scientific exchanges and identify important challenges that remain to be addressed openly and productively by the community. One challenge arises from the real, underlying trend in temperatures during the instrumental period. This trend can affect regression-based reconstruction performance in cases where the calibration period does not appropriately cover the range of conditions encountered during the reconstruction. However, because it is tied to a unique spatial pattern driven by change in radiative balance, the trend cannot simply be removed in the method of climate field reconstruction used by MBH on the statistical argument of preserving degrees of freedom.

Recent instrumental data have shown a remarkable degree of asynchronicity between Northern Hemisphere and Southern Hemisphere temperature fluctuations, thereby questioning the relative importance of internal versus external drivers of past as well as future climate variability1, 2, 3. However, large-scale temperature reconstructions for the past millennium have focused on the Northern Hemisphere4, 5, limiting empirical assessments of inter-hemispheric variability on multi-decadal to centennial timescales. Here, we introduce a new millennial ensemble reconstruction of annually resolved temperature variations for the Southern Hemisphere based on an unprecedented network of terrestrial and oceanic palaeoclimate proxy records. In conjunction with an independent Northern Hemisphere temperature reconstruction ensemble5, this record reveals an extended cold period (1594–1677) in both hemispheres but no globally coherent warm phase during the pre-industrial (1000–1850) era. The current (post-1974) warm phase is the only period of the past millennium where both hemispheres are likely to have experienced contemporaneous warm extremes. Our analysis of inter-hemispheric temperature variability in an ensemble of climate model simulations for the past millennium suggests that models tend to overemphasize Northern Hemisphere–Southern Hemisphere synchronicity by underestimating the role of internal ocean–atmosphere dynamics, particularly in the ocean-dominated Southern Hemisphere. Our results imply that climate system predictability on decadal to century timescales may be lower than expected based on assessments of external climate forcing and Northern Hemisphere temperature variations5, 6 alone."},{"id":1964772454,"microsoftAcademicId":1964772454,"doi":"10.1175/2010jcli3328.1","title":"A Pseudoproxy Evaluation of the CCA and RegEM Methods for Reconstructing Climate Fields of the Last Millennium","authors":[{"LN":"Smerdon","FN":"Jason E."},{"LN":"Kaplan","FN":"Alexey"},{"LN":"Chang","FN":"Diana"},{"LN":"Evans","FN":"Michael N."}],"year":2010,"journal":"Journal of Climate","references":[2096809505,2070257026,1660201747,2131532072,2108531121,2054167751,2151746416,2027745714,2146079950,2067409327,2074964089,2174160981,1967722715,1978887368,2142987884,2123564268,2043514774,1978291154,1982725147,2062457444,1996896637,2060208241,2043831111,1974992986,1996250618,2003326514,2146937853,2335780408,2100055302,1898890511,2059738590,2141077951,2169277953,2105942117,2048485366,2024054778,2135462719,2174817738,1994800218,2077617098,1520479453,2056393075,2088151138,1658326591,2066850544,1582709791,2023189905,2139223514,2142967805,2050413070,2074767856,2066165799,2137101078,2102160239,2089439943,2025336675,1966499954,2115965836,2034751473,2107602834,2056557542,2064908013,2043573028,2037660574,1989997544,2020485766,1984232315,2141430304,2065128000,2150259853,2029670837,1980641310,2015065872,2111874475,2001786727,2134270795,2170349739,2065268105,1987484552,2626598704,2091142565,2058236338],"citationsCount":79,"abstract":"Abstract Canonical correlation analysis (CCA) is evaluated for paleoclimate field reconstructions in the context of pseudoproxy experiments assembled from the millennial integration (850–1999 c.e.) of the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate System Model, version 1.4.

Since instrumental measurements are generally only available after 1850, temperature fields must be reconstructed using paleoclimate archives, known as proxies. Various climate field reconstructions (CFR) methods have been proposed to relate past temperature to such proxy networks. In this work, we propose a new CFR method, called GraphEM, based on Gaussian Markov random fields embedded within an EM algorithm. Gaussian Markov random fields provide a natural and flexible framework for modeling high-dimensional spatial fields. At the same time, they provide the parameter reduction necessary for obtaining precise and well-conditioned estimates of the covariance structure, even in the sample-starved setting common in paleoclimate applications. In this paper, we propose and compare the performance of different methods to estimate the graphical structure of climate fields, and demonstrate how the GraphEM algorithm can be used to reconstruct past climate variations. The performance of GraphEM is compared to the widely used CFR method RegEM with regularization via truncated total least squares, using synthetic data. Our results show that GraphEM can yield significant improvements, with uniform gains over space, and far better risk properties. We demonstrate that the spatial structure of temperature fields can be well estimated by graphs where each neighbor is only connected to a few geographically close neighbors, and that the increase in performance is directly related to recovering the underlying sparsity in the covariance of the spatial field. Our work demonstrates how significant improvements can be made in climate reconstruction methods by better modeling the covariance structure of the climate field."},{"id":2121273076,"microsoftAcademicId":2121273076,"doi":"10.1016/0031-0182(65)90004-0","title":"The early medieval warm epoch and its sequel","authors":[{"LN":"Lamb","FN":"H.H."}],"year":1965,"journal":"Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology","references":[2546433280,2089867014,2768052203,2331730236,2106316021,2126068044,2323737622,2142069364,618498512,2082172276,1969644302,2774406008,1964172757,2319673303,654802435,2581917113,51536656],"citationsCount":735,"abstract":"Abstract<br><br> Evidence has been accumulating in many fields of investigation pointing to a notably warm climate in many parts of the world, that lasted a few centuries around A.D. 1000–1200, and was followed by a decline of temperature levels till between 1500 and 1700 the coldest phase since the last ice age occurred.

The mid-latitude atmospheric circulation is the dominant factor for regional changes in temperature, rainfall, and other climatic variables. Here we present reconstructions of gridded monthly sea level pressure (SLP) fields back to 1659 and seasonal reconstructions from 1500-1658 for the eastern North Atlantic-European region (30°W to 40°E; 30°N to 70°N). These were developed using principal component regression analysis based on the combination of early instrumental station series (pressure, temperature and precipitation) and documentary proxy data from Eurasian sites. The relationships were derived over the 1901-1960 calibration period and verified over 1961-1990. Under the assumption of stationarity in the statistical relationships, a transfer function derived over the 1901-1990 period was used to reconstruct the 500-year large-scale SLP fields. Systematic quality testing indicated reliable winter reconstructions throughout the entire period. Lower skill was obtained for the other seasons, although meaningful monthly reconstructions were available from around 1700 onwards, when station pressure series became available. The quality and the reconstructed SLP fields for two exceptionally cold years (1573, 1740) are discussed and climatologically interpreted. An EOF analysis of the 1500-1999 winter SLP revealed, firstly, a zonal flow pattern with pronounced decadal to centenial time scale variations, secondly, a monopole pattern over northwest Europe and thirdly, a pattern modulating the meridional flow component over Europe. These 500-year SLP reconstructions should be useful for modelling studies, particulary for analyses of low-frequency atmospheric variability and for circulation dynamics."},{"id":1992866464,"microsoftAcademicId":1992866464,"doi":"10.1038/nature08769","title":"Ensemble reconstruction constraints on the global carbon cycle sensitivity to climate","authors":[{"LN":"Frank","FN":"David C."},{"LN":"Esper","FN":"Jan"},{"LN":"Raible","FN":"Christoph C."},{"LN":"Raible","FN":"Christoph C."},{"LN":"Büntgen","FN":"Ulf"},{"LN":"Trouet","FN":"Valerie M"},{"LN":"Stocker","FN":"Benjamin"},{"LN":"Stocker","FN":"Benjamin"},{"LN":"Joos","FN":"Fortunat"},{"LN":"Joos","FN":"Fortunat"}],"year":2010,"journal":"Nature","references":[2939474406,1979440117,2151328940,2160252043,2165037481,2131532072,2054167751,2151746416,2027745714,1965122835,2034795620,2042859974,2074964089,1965358009,2108379304,2142987884,2043514774,1994973226,2129992710,1797264839,2115977576,2062457444,2133306450,2062778690,1974992986,1954525867,2104833230,1969688566,2123450273,1499364211,1989401502,2060095387,2024054778,2091101199,1618184752,2159103614,2077617098,2145796050,2129809782,1497261301,2187518561,2098654378,1511169134,2150621247,2018541493,2152659511,2795447339],"citationsCount":264,"abstract":"Climate warming tends to cause a net release of CO2, which in turn causes an amplification of warming. Estimates of the magnitude of this effect vary widely, leading to a wide range in global warming projections. Recent work suggested that the magnitude of this positive feedback might be about 40 parts per million by volume of CO2 per °C of warming. David Frank and colleagues use three Antarctic ice cores and a suite of climate reconstructions to show that the feedback is likely to be much smaller, with a median of only about 8 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C. Anthropogenic global warming is likely to be amplified by positive feedback from the global carbon cycle; however, the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle, and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate. By combining a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, this climate sensitivity is now shown to be much smaller than previously thought. The processes controlling the carbon flux and carbon storage of the atmosphere, ocean and terrestrial biosphere are temperature sensitive1,2,3,4 and are likely to provide a positive feedback leading to amplified anthropogenic warming3. Owing to this feedback, at timescales ranging from interannual to the 20–100-kyr cycles of Earth's orbital variations1,5,6,7, warming of the climate system causes a net release of CO2 into the atmosphere; this in turn amplifies warming. But the magnitude of the climate sensitivity of the global carbon cycle (termed γ), and thus of its positive feedback strength, is under debate, giving rise to large uncertainties in global warming projections8,9. Here we quantify the median γ as 7.7 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C warming, with a likely range of 1.7–21.4 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C. Sensitivity experiments exclude significant influence of pre-industrial land-use change on these estimates. Our results, based on the coupling of a probabilistic approach with an ensemble of proxy-based temperature reconstructions and pre-industrial CO2 data from three ice cores, provide robust constraints for γ on the policy-relevant multi-decadal to centennial timescales. By using an ensemble of >200,000 members, quantification of γ is not only improved, but also likelihoods can be assigned, thereby providing a benchmark for future model simulations. Although uncertainties do not at present allow exclusion of γ calculated from any of ten coupled carbon–climate models, we find that γ is about twice as likely to fall in the lowermost than in the uppermost quartile of their range. Our results are incompatibly lower (P < 0.05) than recent pre-industrial empirical estimates of ∼40 p.p.m.v. CO2 per °C (refs 6, 7), and correspondingly suggest ∼80% less potential amplification of ongoing global warming."},{"id":1984983544,"microsoftAcademicId":1984983544,"doi":"10.1175/jcli-d-11-00326.1","title":"Last Millennium Climate and Its Variability in CCSM4","authors":[{"LN":"Landrum","FN":"Laura"},{"LN":"Otto-Bliesner","FN":"Bette L."},{"LN":"Wahl","FN":"Eugene R."},{"LN":"Conley","FN":"Andrew"},{"LN":"Lawrence","FN":"Peter J."},{"LN":"Rosenbloom","FN":"Nan"},{"LN":"Teng","FN":"Haiyan"}],"year":2013,"journal":"Journal of Climate","references":[2093401535,2020297738,1985217958,2106963750,2083070320,2120115499,1660201747,2130256070,2158521569,2108531121,2010530988,2054167751,2124757012,2027745714,2122046874,2011526969,2165937826,2131462802,2126147651,2034795620,2128628033,2123559861,2040763894,2170086526,2042859974,2074964089,2038669354,1985370915,1967031773,2017818081,2123564268,2043514774,2034434715,2048792237,1606803730,1982725147,2106548167,1907038160,2052843944,2081342300,2117917479,2019140816,2062457444,2028776183,2097872776,1970412346,2072084781,2012516451,2048071355,2164907207,2056681173,2026413132,2048968715,2616382558,1968257597,2141117266,2154067776,2003326514,2139892221,2146937853,1977434748,2100438471,2181097193,2169074850,1986637027,2164897769,2141077951,2173880861,2070766630,1678348913,2064133961,2055362524,2135462719,2092958903,2132548519,1523815748,2161917327,2056393075,2027954691,2095817630,2100687909,2102295164,2080136777,2155455495,2081992428,1652201389,2049354824,1965454627,1623772631,2142967805,2103655287,2050413070,2001737915,1700325832,1964189041,2009607087,2072882696,2042356119,2102197928,1978849440,2174461843,2139023992,2038592739,2039353903,2020191406,2115965836,2118636179,2123226885,2015323478,2116061942,2098624257,2121413707,2102033158,1540066974,2008031232,2097296159,1979041041,2098084624],"citationsCount":171,"citationContext":{"1623772631":["• Merged the Pongratz et al.

The CCSM4 LM simulation reproduces many large-scale climate patterns suggested by historical and proxy-data records, with Northern Hemisphere (NH) and Southern Hemisphere (SH) surface temperatures cooling to the early 1800s Common Era by ~0.5°C (NH) and ~0.3°C (SH), followed by warming to the present. High latitudes of both hemispheres show polar amplification of the cooling from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age (LIA) associated with sea ice increases. The LM simulation does not reproduce La Nina–like cooling in the eastern Pacific Ocean during the MCA relative to the LIA, as has been suggested by proxy reconstructions. Still, dry medieval conditions over the southwestern and central United States are simulated in agreement with proxy indicators for these regions.

The records are from trees, ice, sediment, corals, speleothems, documentary evidence, and other archives. They range in length from 50 to 2000 years, with a median of 547 years, while temporal resolution ranges from biweekly to centennial. Nearly half of the proxy time series are significantly correlated with HadCRUT4.2 surface temperature over the period 1850–2014. Global temperature composites show a remarkable degree of coherence between high- and low-resolution archives, with broadly similar patterns across archive types, terrestrial versus marine locations, and screening criteria.

In particular, a reconstructed “La Nina-like” pattern during the transition from the Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA) to the Little Ice Age has been widely tied to medieval droughts in southwest North America. This pattern is now used as a key benchmark for global climate model simulations of the last millennium, which have yet to reproduce it. Here we test the pattern's robustness by using four different CFR methods and two proxy networks. With the older network, we find the reconstructed patterns to be highly method-dependent, with the La Nina-like pattern not reproduced by two of the CFR methodologies. With the updated proxy network, a globally uniform MCA emerges with all methods, in agreement with simulations from the Paleoclimate Modelling Intercomparison Project Phase 3 ensemble.

However, the relationship be-tween ice depth and ice age generally cannot be easily es-tablished and requires the combination of numerous investi-gations and/or modelling efforts. This paper presents a new approach to ice core dating based on time–frequency anal-ysis of chemical profiles at a site where seasonal patterns may be significantly distorted by sporadic events of regional importance, specifically at the summit area of Nevado Illi-mani (6350 m a.s.l.), located in the eastern Bolivian Andes (16 37 0 S, 67 46 0 W). We used ion concentration depth pro-files collected along a 100 m deep ice core. The results of Fourier time–frequency and wavelet transforms were first compared. Both methods were applied to a nitrate concentra-tion depth profile. The resulting chronologies were checked by comparison with the multi-proxy year-by-year dating published by de Angelis et al. (2003) and with volcanic tie points. With this first experiment, we demonstrated the effi-ciency of Fourier time–frequency analysis when tracking the nitrate natural variability. In addition, we were able to show spectrum aliasing due to under-sampling below 70 m. In this article, we propose a method of de-aliasing which signifi-cantly improves the core dating in comparison with annual layer manual counting. Fourier time–frequency analysis was applied to concentration depth profiles of seven other ions, providing information on the suitability of each of them for the dating of tropical Andean ice cores."},{"id":2025720061,"microsoftAcademicId":2025720061,"doi":"10.1198/016214506000001437","title":"Strictly Proper Scoring Rules, Prediction, and Estimation","authors":[{"LN":"Gneiting","FN":"Tilmann"},{"LN":"Raftery","FN":"Adrian E"}],"year":2007,"journal":"Journal of the American Statistical Association","references":[2057765075,2153529786,2168175751,2040503026,1539462193,1977970167,2027255954,2158840489,2130715829,2170206178,2046649434,1546961578,2079025608,1976255336,2016440615,2118711140,1545465591,2178242555,1590693676,2132558761,2127874106,2174362514,1973744648,179694669,2011292888,2129606454,2180267979,1571413698,1994884074,2180576529,2099756352,2124395162,2156967175,2471967545,1489087445,1999617766,2108871462,2046033161,370143576,199260962,2059078244,2181151222,1969705577,48332454,2109041929,2114119944,2786093300,2145911539,2103574516,2158471180,2027216529,2118713001,1967396577,2122759946,2076204683,2177082044,2060442802,1994331360,1969404663,2029257381,1998274472,2033468335,82989352,1582539699,1969564520,2159463664,2145864490,1522863251,1982575727,1967289526,2155499580,92802620,2081531484,2061509875,2002270895,2088704293,1997647721,2138241424,2175631593,2725275303,2054571746,1984113680,2126163471,2002471330,2094952960,1708211919,2021772914,204889195,1986797382,2034767804,2073241381,1524591749,2109720509,2025792046,2076845236,2172939121,1987103639,2025410634,2025817335,2119929915,1646248817,1555934787,151868691,2155440162,1493831810,124301439,207839918,2123248504,121739997,2001854273,1986055049,2066661957,2904883024,2008709824,2000004528,2085602280,2029552385,383826941,186675064],"citationsCount":2586,"citationContext":{"48332454":["Following Grünwald and Dawid (2004) and Buja et al."],"82989352":["If P belongs to Pβ , then theorem 1 of Székely (2003) implies the equality of the right sides in (22) and (24).","Theorem 1 of Székely (2003) shows that the energy score is strictly proper relative to the class Pβ .","We introduce a generalization of the CRPS that draws on Székely’s (2003) statistical energy perspective."],"92802620":["Gneiting, Raftery, Balabdaoui and Westveld (2003)  contend that the goal of probabilistic forecasting is to maximize sharpness subject to calibration."],"121739997":["Eaton, Giovagnoli, and Sebastiani (1996) used the associated divergence function"],"199260962":["(53) Dawid (1984) showed that Sk,B is asymptotically equivalent to the plug-in maximum likelihood prequential score","Consequently, forecasts should be probabilistic in nature, taking the form of probability distributions over future quantities or events (Dawid 1984).","Dawid (2006) has given details and discussed the generality of the construction.","Following Grünwald and Dawid (2004) and Buja, Stuetzle, and Shen (2005), we call the expected score function","For other examples of scoring rules that depend on μP and P only, see (23) and the right column of table 1 of Dawid and Sebastiani (1999).

Multimodel simulations of the past millennium are used together with a wide range of reconstructions of Northern Hemispheric mean annual temperature to separate climate variability from 850 to 1950 CE into components attributable to external forcing and internal climate variability. External forcing is found to contribute significantly to long-term temperature variations irrespective of the proxy reconstruction, particularly from 1400 onward. Over the MCA alone, however, the effect of forcing is only detectable in about half of the reconstructions considered, and the response to forcing in the models cannot explain the warm conditions around 1000 CE seen in some reconstructions. The residual from the detection analysis is used to estimate internal variability independent from climate modeling, and it is found that the recent observed 50and100-yrhemispheric temperaturetrendsaresubstantiallylargerthananyoftheinternallygeneratedtrends even using the large residuals over the MCA. Variations in solar output and explosive volcanism are found to be the main drivers of climate change from 1400 to 1900, but for the first time a significant contribution from greenhouse gas variations to the cold conditions during 1600‐1800 is also detected. The proxy reconstructions tend to show a smaller forced response than is simulated by the models. This discrepancy is shown, at least partly, to be likely associated with the difference in the response to large volcanic eruptions between reconstructions and model simulations."},{"id":2461294398,"microsoftAcademicId":2461294398,"doi":"10.1002/wcc.418","title":"Reconstructing Earth's surface temperature over the past 2000 years: the science behind the headlines","authors":[{"LN":"Smerdon","FN":"Jason E."},{"LN":"Pollack","FN":"Henry N."}],"year":2016,"journal":"Wiley Interdisciplinary Reviews: Climate Change","references":[2024966118,2132555912,2031027346,1660201747,2131532072,2108531121,1974470230,2054167751,2134358106,2151746416,2027745714,2122046874,2011526969,2135496572,2146079950,1971250671,2126147651,2005409799,2074964089,1985201273,2174160981,1965358009,2142987884,2124141200,2123564268,2043514774,1978291154,1619751255,2062457444,2072084781,2148200724,1983742724,2002972888,2176417267,2043831111,1974992986,2289190183,2085873135,2125281275,2100055302,1898890511,2171575383,2062463872,1986637027,2174462014,2128062444,2059738590,1938960447,2229711034,2169277953,2105942117,2173880861,1941426989,1999037513,2063295526,2048485366,2105384926,2102846561,1984983544,1550598685,2034144235,2062219811,2015071882,2135462719,1965241133,2171125351,2133791054,2033160101,2043644850,1989246564,1994800218,2140001392,1617904705,1934263059,1924860203,2088151138,2134720554,1497261301,1658326591,1971880248,2048351585,2132304065,2158143330,2066850544,2158569873,2169242888,2388847782,2097825069,2237559385,2056453952,2058730863,2098654378,2139223514,2142967805,2050413070,2074767856,2252920674,2100984388,2066165799,2144133989,1700325832,2139417782,2145861670,2098730767,2038473673,1967170772,2109378699,2180301600,1851524102,2137101078,2102197928,2125453764,2102160239,2315357523,2089439943,2102004532,2028459940,2038592739,2095785471,2158317250,2118884916,2149413089,2033054846,1858915186,2124705466,1966499954,1964772454,2018805546,2094320489,2128772124,2096164598,2098254516,2107602834,1002755731,2056557542,2047208054,904621797,2064908013,1837968393,1983836714,2006514423,1556515778,2138932870,1989997544,2117102018,2035013501,1989058095,2020485766,2059729743,1750913516,2096654418,2048441179,2136563179,2079778790,1990701941,2101284100,2126509979,2150259853,2061501879,2009560512,1980641310,2015065872,2134934579,2111874475,2050710625,2001786727,2134270795,1589711561,2170349739,2099285484,2094923214,2059977944,2085833214,1987484552,2335961323,1977872526,2113176916,2091142565,2121273076,2120514973,2143238780,1667213644,2058236338,2156309899,2123355591,2138748819],"citationsCount":27,"abstract":"The last quarter century spans the publication of the first assessment report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change in 1990 and the latest report published in 2013–2014. The five assessment reports appearing over that interval reveal a marked increase in the number of paleoclimate studies addressing the climate of the last 2000 years (the Common Era). An important focus of this work has been on reconstruction of hemispheric and global temperatures. Several early studies in this area generated considerable scientific and public interest, and were followed by high-profile and sometimes vitriolic debates about the magnitude of temperature changes over all or part of the Common Era and their comparison to 20th- and 21st-century global temperature increases due to increasing levels of atmospheric greenhouse gases. Behind the more public debates, however, several consistent themes of scientific inquiry have developed to better characterize climate variability and change over the Common Era. These include attempts to collect more climate proxy archives and understand the signals they contain, improve the statistical methods used to estimate past temperature variability from proxies and their associated uncertainties, and to compare reconstructed temperature variability and change with climate model simulations. All of these efforts are driving a new age of research on the climate of the Common Era that is developing more cohesive and collaborative investigations into the dynamics of climate on time scales of decades to centuries, and an understanding of the implications for modeled climate projections of the future.

Since systematic instrumental temperature records only extend back to the nineteenth century, such knowledge mainly relies on climate-sensitive proxy data. Here we critically assess some of the many challenges related to large-scale multiproxy temperature reconstructions. We begin with a review of available large-scale temperature reconstructions, focusing on the differences in low-frequency variability and the response to natural forcings such as major volcanic eruptions and changes in total solar irradiance. Then, we discuss different proxy selection strategies, review previously used reconstruction methods, and discuss their ability to reconstruct the amplitude of the low-frequency variability. To shed additional light on the challenges of large-scale reconstructions, we investigate the spatial and temporal correlation structures in the observed temperature field and discuss the implications of these correlation structures regarding the required number and positions of proxies. We demonstrate how the unavoidable uncertainty related to noisy proxies will show up as bias and variance in the reconstruction and that the partition between these forms of errors depends on the reconstruction method. Pseudo-proxy experiments are conducted to further discuss the influence of noise and the requirements regarding the geographical location and number of proxies necessary for reliably reconstructing the low-frequency variability. We conclude with recommendations for future large-scale temperature reconstructions."},{"id":1980730034,"microsoftAcademicId":1980730034,"doi":"10.5194/cp-11-533-2015","title":"Technical Note: Probabilistically constraining proxy age–depth models within a Bayesian hierarchical reconstruction model","authors":[{"LN":"Werner","FN":"J.

Reconstructions of the late-Holocene climate rely heavily upon proxies that are assumed to be accurately dated by layer counting, such as measurements of tree rings, ice cores, and varved lake sediments. Considerable advances could be achieved if time-uncertain proxies were able to be included within these multiproxy reconstructions, and if time uncertainties were recognized and correctly modeled for proxies commonly treated as free of age model errors.<br><br><br>Current approaches for accounting for time uncertainty are generally limited to repeating the reconstruction using each one of an ensemble of age models, thereby inflating the final estimated uncertainty – in effect, each possible age model is given equal weighting. Uncertainties can be reduced by exploiting the inferred space–time covariance structure of the climate to re-weight the possible age models. Here, we demonstrate how Bayesian hierarchical climate reconstruction models can be augmented to account for time-uncertain proxies. Critically, although a priori all age models are given equal probability of being correct, the probabilities associated with the age models are formally updated within the Bayesian framework, thereby reducing uncertainties. Numerical experiments show that updating the age model probabilities decreases uncertainty in the resulting reconstructions, as compared with the current de facto standard of sampling over all age models, provided there is sufficient information from other data sources in the spatial region of the time-uncertain proxy. This approach can readily be generalized to non-layer-counted proxies, such as those derived from marine sediments."},{"id":2094688663,"microsoftAcademicId":2094688663,"doi":"10.1175/jcli3612.1","title":"Present-Day Atmospheric Simulations Using GISS ModelE: Comparison to In Situ, Satellite, and Reanalysis Data","authors":[{"LN":"Schmidt","FN":"Gavin A."},{"LN":"Ruedy","FN":"Reto"},{"LN":"Hansen","FN":"James E."},{"LN":"Aleinov","FN":"Igor"},{"LN":"Bell","FN":"Nadine"},{"LN":"Bauer","FN":"Mike"},{"LN":"Bauer","FN":"Susanne"},{"LN":"Cairns","FN":"Brian"},{"LN":"Canuto","FN":"Vittorio"},{"LN":"Cheng","FN":"Ye"},{"LN":"Genio","FN":"Anthony Del"},{"LN":"Faluvegi","FN":"Greg"},{"LN":"Friend","FN":"Andrew D."},{"LN":"Hall","FN":"Tim M."},{"LN":"Hu","FN":"Yongyun"},{"LN":"Kelley","FN":"Max"},{"LN":"Kiang","FN":"Nancy Y."},{"LN":"Koch","FN":"Dorothy"},{"LN":"Lacis","FN":"Andy A."},{"LN":"Lerner","FN":"Jean"},{"LN":"Lo","FN":"Ken K."},{"LN":"Miller","FN":"Ron L."},{"LN":"Nazarenko","FN":"Larissa"},{"LN":"Oinas","FN":"Valdar"},{"LN":"Perlwitz","FN":"Jan"},{"LN":"Perlwitz","FN":"Judith"},{"LN":"Rind","FN":"David"},{"LN":"Romanou","FN":"Anastasia"},{"LN":"Russell","FN":"Gary L."},{"LN":"Sato","FN":"Makiko"},{"LN":"Shindell","FN":"Drew T."},{"LN":"Stone","FN":"Peter H."},{"LN":"Sun","FN":"Shan"},{"LN":"Tausnev","FN":"Nick"},{"LN":"Thresher","FN":"Duane"},{"LN":"Yao","FN":"Mao-Sung"}],"year":2006,"journal":"Journal of Climate","references":[1522296012,2006165291,2020297738,2176956584,1985479415,2096809505,2045470555,2133484165,1579893055,2013537840,2137169911,2019812041,67812752,2106256460,2038742869,1969583657,2006563460,2148592335,1997499217,1547067099,2157002639,2097052086,2154409236,2041158780,168399174,2155654615,2159110989,2094611979,2054652969,2000464111,2055902907,1625533523,2146719438,1510447231,59815194,1963676515,2044940833,1981646498,2148487473,2104127988,2026422942,1989790045,2059756096,2043986368,1979939918,2056751206,2089785418,2176990229,1987461785,2121994682,2074435632,2170547250,1972125997,2115950861,2134362679,2158992723,2090785751,2059205508,2054088207,159995897,1998835472,1976144170,1758058526,2029896116,2047442548,1562616331,2146309740,1976913624,1974605993,2152846021,2015179509,1963536423,2072992577,2148233761,2042058640,1972515913,2075609411,1977314054,2040620579,2003636035,1973508392,1965981379,2006459809,2173218178,2035741722,2174517447,2144616126,1996871720,2075954098,2118739416,2084107098,1967170772,2118471988,2040195880,1969005344,1973707151,2162655192,2119531124,2180259585,2060969273,2173752470,1978547911,2143704430,2180666548,2066992347,2092625175,2033226370,1911533441,2057285747,2084172080,2115013012,2180384338,2179455917,2022435121,1999123335,2140343068,2102421198,1989028309,2021598361,2116584463,2060782609,2127415689,2091534926,2159713378,1990354284,921371042,1979895664,2119980699,2171279241,2048329214,2130683466,2147538817,1973872808,1988064628,1963975479,1967603464,2028550668,2156956984,1979550685,2173031829,2036772899,2107401151,2092034699,1939914269,955005786,2177368025,2006513589,2179375492,757317082,1524974880,2057129049,2143871731,25854986,1605845253],"citationsCount":830,"citationContext":{"59815194":["Ocean and ocean ice are treated as rough bluff surface, with z0m combining the smooth surface value (Brutsaert 1982) with the Charnock relation for the aerodynamic roughness length;

Geogr. Ann., 87 A (1): 17-36. ABSTRACT. This review focuses on the develop- ment of the 'Little Ice Age' as a glaciological and cli- matic concept, and evaluates its current usefulness in the light of new data on the glacier and climatic variations of the last millennium and of the Holocene. 'Little Ice Age' glacierization occurred over about 650 years and can be defined most pre- cisely in the European Alps (c. AD 1300-1950) when extended glaciers were larger than before or since. 'Little Ice Age' climate is defined as a shorter time interval of about 330 years (c. AD 1570-1900) when Northern Hemisphere summer temperatures (land areas north of 20°N) fell significantly below the AD 1961-1990 mean. This climatic definition overlaps the times when the Alpine glaciers attained their lat- est two highstands (AD 1650 and 1850). It is empha- sized, however, that 'Little Ice Age' glacierization was highly dependent on winter precipitation and that 'Little Ice Age' climate was not simply a matter of summer temperatures. Both the glacier-centred and the climate-centred concepts necessarily en- compass considerable spatial and temporal varia- bility, which are investigated using maps of mean summer temperature variations over the Northern Hemisphere at 30-year intervals from AD 1571 to 1900. 'Little Ice Age'-type events occurred earlier in the Holocene as exemplified by at least seven gla- cier expansion episodes that have been identified in southern Norway. Such events provide a broader context and renewed relevance for the 'Little Ice Age', which may be viewed as a 'modern analogue' for the earlier events; and the likelihood that similar events will occur in the future has implications for climatic change in the twenty-first century. It is con- cluded that the concept of a 'Little Ice Age' will re- main useful only by (1) continuing to incorporate the temporal and spatial complexities of glacier and climatic variations as they become better known, and (2) by reflecting improved understanding of the Earth-atmosphere-ocean system and its forcing factors through the interaction of palaeoclimatic re- construction with climate modelling."},{"id":2348085231,"microsoftAcademicId":2348085231,"doi":"10.1175/jcli-d-13-00781.1","title":"Australasian Temperature Reconstructions Spanning the Last Millennium","authors":[{"LN":"Gergis","FN":"Joelle Lyndsay"},{"LN":"Neukom","FN":"Raphael"},{"LN":"Neukom","FN":"Raphael"},{"LN":"Gallant","FN":"Ailie"},{"LN":"Karoly","FN":"David John"}],"year":2016,"journal":"Journal of Climate","references":[2006165291,1979440117,2096809505,2070257026,2108531121,1982846260,2151746416,2078580016,2094688663,1980106771,2135496572,2146079950,2042859974,2083178128,2074964089,2156102187,2038669354,1981256179,2123564268,1978291154,1606803730,2147569451,2177291244,2068090847,2117917479,2075746856,2062457444,2097872776,1992866464,2175808424,1983742724,2062778690,2095538499,2007377949,2141117266,2255080690,1560946750,1974992986,2087236725,1996250618,2090246574,2052478647,2007012175,1631967728,2139892221,2146937853,2155224709,2122125911,2096763947,2105942117,1965514539,2082073896,2034144235,2038006301,2062219811,2171125351,2133791054,2024259303,2063340639,2008832614,1983113873,2095817630,1970995858,2624731095,2138785184,2170436314,2014968686,2018798324,2123920604,1892599811,2097825069,2237559385,2070137502,2145917310,2001737915,1976810938,2008537817,2024745830,1991045371,2019804337,2080994223,2134564284,2083714093,2116011402,2102197928,2086399840,2050458479,2075218266,1995676835,1525400741,1561001428,2014602425,2120120577,2115965836,2017700157,2077556333,2140157892,1908697507,2089605147,2157574221,2073551447,2005686580,1968654705,2133936217,2099794669,2003409151,1964647748,2055498028,1978874030,2116616038,1530011496,2046418169,2066794100,954445893,2100075457,2162140237,2019885534,2106850978,1513857566,2021329690,2092914914,2737621896,2005265029,1928887355,2051525724,1971906034,1577101586,2069038387,1577662763,1961773873,2598382724,2121273076,1484250421,2039990632,2000777479],"citationsCount":22,"abstract":"AbstractMultiproxy warm season (September–February) temperature reconstructions are presented for the combined land–ocean region of Australasia (0°–50°S, 110°E–180°) covering 1000–2001.

A skilful rainfall reconstruction for the 1783–1988 period was possible using twelve annually-resolved palaeoclimate records from the Australasian region. An innovative Monte Carlo calibration and verification technique is introduced to provide the robust uncertainty estimates needed for reliable climate reconstructions. Our ensemble median reconstruction captures 33% of inter-annual and 72% of decadal variations in instrumental SEA rainfall observations. We investigate the stability of regional SEA rainfall with large-scale circulation associated with El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) and the Inter-decadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) over the past 206 years. We find evidence for a robust relationship with high SEA rainfall, ENSO and the IPO over the 1840–1988 period. These relationships break down in the late 18th–early 19th century, coinciding with a known period of equatorial Pacific Sea Surface Temperature (SST) cooling during one of the most severe periods of the Little Ice Age. In comparison to a markedly wetter late 18th/early 19th century containing 75% of sustained wet years, 70% of all reconstructed sustained dry years in SEA occur during the 20th century. In the context of the rainfall estimates introduced here, there is a 97.1% probability that the decadal rainfall anomaly recorded during the 1998–2008 ‘Big Dry’ is the worst experienced since the first European settlement of Australia."},{"id":1826016929,"microsoftAcademicId":1826016929,"doi":"10.1002/env.2368","title":"Reconstruction of late Holocene climate based on tree growth and mechanistic hierarchical models","authors":[{"LN":"Tipton","FN":"John"},{"LN":"Hooten","FN":"Mevin B."},{"LN":"Hooten","FN":"Mevin B."},{"LN":"Pederson","FN":"Neil"},{"LN":"Tingley","FN":"Martin"},{"LN":"Bishop","FN":"Daniel"}],"year":2016,"journal":"Environmetrics","references":[2582743722,1981457167,2025720061,2148534890,146619314,2030597423,2130715829,1566333899,2054167751,2151746416,2075965721,2067409327,2074964089,2048776980,2106201557,1981256179,2123564268,2396871564,2283666662,2114100577,2002972888,2087236725,2003326514,2100055302,2161132263,568352374,2174462014,2105942117,1997369189,2034144235,2165562007,2157129937,1989246564,1511839553,2121013971,1618765701,2097825069,1993644449,2153536767,2180301600,2137101078,1976041275,2118636179,1997557228,2091300140,2056557542,70397570,2055206019,1980730034,2079778790,2159837990,2138537852,2071398965],"citationsCount":11,"citationContext":{"2030597423":["Implementation of a hybrid Metropolis–Hastings and Gibbs MCMC algorithm allows for estimation of the posterior distribution (Banerjee et al., 2004; Carlin and Louis, 2011)."],"2087236725":["To validate our predictive model, we translate and scale the reconstruction of Palmer Drought Severity Index (PDSI) in Pederson et al.

Statistical prediction of paleoclimate from tree ring widths is challenging because tree ring widths are a one-dimensional summary of annual growth that represents a multi-dimensional set of climatic and biotic influences. We develop a Bayesian hierarchical framework using a nonlinear, biologically motivated tree ring growth model to jointly reconstruct temperature and precipitation in the Hudson Valley, New York. Using a common growth function to describe the response of a tree to climate, we allow for species-specific parameterizations of the growth response. To enable predictive backcasts, we model the climate variables with a vector autoregressive process on an annual timescale coupled with a multivariate conditional autoregressive process that accounts for temporal correlation and cross-correlation between temperature and precipitation on a monthly scale. Our multi-scale temporal model allows for flexibility in the climate response through time at different temporal scales and predicts reasonable climate scenarios given tree ring width data.

Nine annually resolved paleoclimate proxy records from the Australasian region are used to develop a reconstruction of streamflow from 1783 to 1988. An ensemble of reconstructions is presented, providing probabilistic estimates of River Murray flows for each year back in time. The best-estimate reconstruction captures approximately 23% (50%) of annual (decadal) naturalized streamflow variability. High and low streamflow phases and their association with decadal climate variability in the Pacific are discussed. Reconstructed River Murray streamflow shows considerable variation since 1783. We estimate that there is a 2.3% chance that the 1998–2008 record low decadal streamflow deficit has been exceeded since European settlement. Stochastic simulations of the decadal variations in River Murray streamflow are computed using the paleostreamflow reconstruction to estimate model parameters. From these simulations, we estimate that the 1998–2008 streamflow deficit has an approximate 1 in 1500 year return period. As climate models are assessed relative to short instrumental records, future projections of decadal-scale variations in Murray-Darling Basin (MDB) streamflow may be inadequately represented. Given the immense socioeconomic importance of Australia's “food bowl,” future paleoclimate and modeling efforts should be directed at understanding variability at this scale. This would greatly enhance our capacity to estimate regional sensitivity of the MDB's hydroclimate to further anthropogenic influences."},{"id":2122004905,"microsoftAcademicId":2122004905,"doi":"10.5194/gmd-5-649-2012","title":"The CSIRO Mk3L climate system model version 1.0 – Part 2: Response to external forcings","authors":[{"LN":"Phipps","FN":"S.

The CSIRO Mk3L climate system model is a coupled general circulation model, designed primarily for millennial-scale climate simulation and palaeoclimate research. Mk3L includes components which describe the atmosphere, ocean, sea ice and land surface, and combines computational efficiency with a stable and realistic control climatology. It is freely available to the research community. This paper evaluates the response of the model to external forcings which correspond to past and future changes in the climate system.<br><br><br>A simulation of the mid-Holocene climate is performed, in which changes in the seasonal and meridional distribution of incoming solar radiation are imposed. Mk3L correctly simulates increased summer temperatures at northern mid-latitudes and cooling in the tropics. However, it is unable to capture some of the regional-scale features of the mid-Holocene climate, with the precipitation over Northern Africa being deficient. The model simulates a reduction of between 7 and 15% in the amplitude of El Nino-Southern Oscillation, a smaller decrease than that implied by the palaeoclimate record. However, the realism of the simulated ENSO is limited by the model's relatively coarse spatial resolution.<br><br><br>Transient simulations of the late Holocene climate are then performed. The evolving distribution of insolation is imposed, and an acceleration technique is applied and assessed. The model successfully captures the temperature changes in each hemisphere and the upward trend in ENSO variability. However, the lack of a dynamic vegetation scheme does not allow it to simulate an abrupt desertification of the Sahara.<br><br><br>To assess the response of Mk3L to other forcings, transient simulations of the last millennium are performed. Changes in solar irradiance, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations and volcanic emissions are applied to the model. The model is again broadly successful at simulating larger-scale changes in the climate system. Both the magnitude and the spatial pattern of the simulated 20th century warming are consistent with observations. However, the model underestimates the magnitude of the relative warmth associated with the Mediaeval Climate Anomaly.<br><br><br>Finally, three transient simulations are performed, in which the atmospheric CO2 concentration is stabilised at two, three and four times the pre-industrial value. All three simulations exhibit ongoing surface warming, reduced sea ice cover, and a reduction in the rate of North Atlantic Deep Water formation followed by its gradual recovery. Antarctic Bottom Water formation ceases, with the shutdown being permanent for a trebling and quadrupling of the CO2 concentration. The transient and equilibrium climate sensitivities of the model are determined. The short-term transient response to a doubling of the CO2 concentration at 1% per year is a warming of 1.59 ± 0.08 K, while the long-term equilibrium response is a warming of at least 3.85 ± 0.02 K."},{"id":2004438678,"microsoftAcademicId":2004438678,"doi":"10.1029/tr020i004p00518","title":"Report of Committee on Glaciers, April 1939","authors":[{"LN":"Matthes","FN":"François E."}],"year":1939,"journal":"Eos, Transactions American Geophysical Union","references":[],"citationsCount":188,"abstract":"The Committee on Glaciers at present is constituted as follows:\r\n\r\nHarry Fielding Reid—Professor-Emeritus of Geology, Johns Hopkins University (former member of the International Glacier Commission), 608 Cathedral Street, Baltimore, Maryland\r\n\r\nWilliam H.

This model includes an interactive carbon cycle, a representation of tropospheric and stratospheric chemistry, and a comprehensive representation of aerosols. As it represents the principal dynamical, physical, and bio-geochemical processes relevant to the climate system, it may be referred to as an Earth System Model. However, the IPSL-CM5 model may be used in a multitude of configurations associated with different boundary conditions and with a range of complexities in terms of processes and interactions. This paper presents an overview of the different model components and explains how they were coupled and used to simulate historical climate changes over the past 150 years and different scenarios of future climate change. A single version of the IPSL-CM5 model (IPSL-CM5A-LR) was used to provide climate projections associated with different socio-economic scenarios, including the different Representative Concentration Pathways considered by CMIP5 and several scenarios from the Special Report on Emission Scenarios considered by CMIP3. Results suggest that the magnitude of global warming projections primarily depends on the socio-economic scenario considered, that there is potential for an aggressive mitigation policy to limit global warming to about two degrees, and that the behavior of some components of the climate system such as the Arctic sea ice and the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation may change drastically by the end of the twenty-first century in the case of a no climate policy scenario. Although the magnitude of regional temperature and precipitation changes depends fairly linearly on the magnitude of the projected global warming (and thus on the scenario considered), the geographical pattern of these changes is strikingly similar for the different scenarios. The representation of atmospheric physical processes in the model is shown to strongly influence the simulated climate variability and both the magnitude and pattern of the projected climate changes."},{"id":1983066276,"microsoftAcademicId":1983066276,"doi":"10.1126/science.1132588","title":"ENSO as an Integrating Concept in Earth Science","authors":[{"LN":"McPhaden","FN":"Michael J."},{"LN":"Zebiak","FN":"Stephen E."},{"LN":"Glantz","FN":"Michael H."}],"year":2006,"journal":"Science","references":[2024649846,2058662258,2061328952,2149567119,1999733221,2150700909,2021705657,1975039560,2059603179,2104511903,1970020090,2021470958,2141604188,2147569451,2063940323,1482932425,2139455631,1980051345,2041168744,2142896906,2046375586,2061877716,1490949357,2047434938,1665630250,2744598003,2098596506,1987611973,1982221421,2113105984,2024717797,2047309253],"citationsCount":923,"citationContext":{"1975039560":["Historically, droughtrelated crop failures due to El Nino were a major contributor to famine that would periodically devastate vulnerable populations ( 53 )."]},"abstract":"The El Nino–Southern Oscillation (ENSO) cycle of alternating warm El Nino and cold La Nina events is the dominant year-to-year climate signal on Earth.

This paper describes the ocean state and circulation as well as basic aspects of variability in simulations contributing to the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). The performance of the ocean/sea-ice model MPIOM, coupled to a new version of the atmosphere model ECHAM6 and modules for land surface and ocean biogeochemistry, is assessed for two model versions with different grid resolution in the ocean. The low-resolution configuration has a nominal resolution of 1.5°, whereas the higher resolution version features a quasiuniform, eddy-permitting global resolution of 0.4°. The paper focuses on important oceanic features, such as surface temperature and salinity, water mass distribution, large-scale circulation, and heat and freshwater transports. In general, these integral quantities are simulated well in comparison with observational estimates, and improvements in comparison with the predecessor system are documented; for example, for tropical variability and sea ice representation. Introducing an eddy-permitting grid configuration in the ocean leads to improvements, in particular, in the representation of interior water mass properties in the Atlantic and in the representation of important ocean currents, such as the Agulhas and Equatorial current systems. In general, however, there are more similarities than differences between the two grid configurations, and several shortcomings, known from earlier versions of the coupled model, prevail."},{"id":2794728810,"microsoftAcademicId":2794728810,"doi":"10.1038/s41586-018-0006-5","title":"Observed fingerprint of a weakening Atlantic Ocean overturning circulation","authors":[{"LN":"Caesar","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Caesar","FN":"L."},{"LN":"Rahmstorf","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Rahmstorf","FN":"S."},{"LN":"Robinson","FN":"Alexander"},{"LN":"Feulner","FN":"G."},{"LN":"Saba","FN":"V."}],"year":2018,"journal":"Nature","references":[2024966118,2924055038,2006165291,2131477567,1608013130,2108527489,2073141004,2024081693,2072228305,2144736649,2035891155,2968634674,2001061636,2010690624,2022350358,2108684521,1991467573,2124140738,2738516213,2108274925,2007880286,2213026911,2359575120,2064581421,2012119251,2415523405,2965874548,2013485750,1986954778,2278081136,1501961051,2118661143,2050680642,2560619159,2160497360,2007729656,2070541435,2568521921,2460183554,1987585697,1996140761,2287711206,2107446221,2402643682,2041814657,2016238032,2473336205,2752993302,2174880766,2556251739,2623792081,2125304624,2738916952,2591396142,1862158195,2066418536,2105997303,2077040264,2125332228,2123668931,2245428403,2749095415,2751448001,2588323478],"citationsCount":126,"abstract":"The Atlantic meridional overturning circulation (AMOC)—a system of ocean currents in the North Atlantic—has a major impact on climate, yet its evolution during the industrial era is poorly known owing to a lack of direct current measurements.

This weakening is revealed by a characteristic spatial and seasonal sea-surface temperature ‘fingerprint’—consisting of a pattern of cooling in the subpolar Atlantic Ocean and warming in the Gulf Stream region—and is calibrated through an ensemble of model simulations from the CMIP5 project. We find this fingerprint both in a high-resolution climate model in response to increasing atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, and in the temperature trends observed since the late nineteenth century. The pattern can be explained by a slowdown in the AMOC and reduced northward heat transport, as well as an associated northward shift of the Gulf Stream.

Here, within the framework of the PAGES Antarctica2k working group, we build an enlarged database of ice core water stable isotope records from Antarctica, consisting of 112 records. We produce both unweighted and weighted isotopic ( δ<br>18 O) composites and temperature reconstructions since 0 CE, binned at 5- and 10-year resolution, for seven climatically distinct regions covering the Antarctic continent. Following earlier work of the Antarctica2k working group, we also produce composites and reconstructions for the broader regions of East Antarctica, West Antarctica and the whole continent. We use three methods for our temperature reconstructions: (i) a temperature scaling based on the<br>δ<br>18 O–temperature relationship output from an ECHAM5-wiso model simulation nudged to ERA-Interim atmospheric reanalyses from 1979 to 2013, and adjusted for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet region to borehole temperature data, (ii) a temperature scaling of the isotopic normalized anomalies to the variance of the regional reanalysis temperature and (iii) a composite-plus-scaling approach used in a previous continent-scale reconstruction of Antarctic temperature since 1 CE but applied to the new Antarctic ice core database. Our new reconstructions confirm a significant cooling trend from 0 to 1900 CE across all Antarctic regions where records extend back into the 1st millennium, with the exception of the Wilkes Land coast and Weddell Sea coast regions. Within this long-term cooling trend from 0 to 1900 CE, we find that the warmest period occurs between 300 and 1000 CE, and the coldest interval occurs from 1200 to 1900 CE. Since 1900 CE, significant warming trends are identified for the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, the Dronning Maud Land coast and the Antarctic Peninsula regions, and these trends are robust across the distribution of records that contribute to the unweighted isotopic composites and also significant in the weighted temperature reconstructions. Only for the Antarctic Peninsula is this most recent century-scale trend unusual in the context of natural variability over the last 2000 years. However, projected warming of the Antarctic continent during the 21st century may soon see significant and unusual warming develop across other parts of the Antarctic continent. The extended Antarctica2k ice core isotope database developed by this working group opens up many avenues for developing a deeper understanding of the response of Antarctic climate to natural and anthropogenic climate forcings.

Understanding this period and the subsequent slowdown of warming is key to disentangling the relationship between decadal variability and the response to human influences in the present and future climate. This review discusses the observed changes during the ETCW and hypotheses for the underlying causes and mechanisms. Attribution studies estimate that about a half (40-54%; p > .8) of the global warming from 1901 to 1950 was forced by a combination of increasing greenhouse gases and natural forcing, offset to some extent by aerosols. Natural variability also made a large contribution, particularly to regional anomalies like the Arctic warming in the 1920s and 1930s. The ETCW period also encompassed exceptional events, several of which are touched upon: Indian monsoon failures during the turn of the century, the \"Dust Bowl\" droughts and extreme heat waves in North America in the 1930s, the World War II period drought in Australia between 1937 and 1945; and the European droughts and heat waves of the late 1940s and early 1950s. Understanding the mechanisms involved in these events, and their links to large scale forcing is an important test for our understanding of modern climate change and for predicting impacts of future change.

For some metrics such as Northern Hemisphere mean temperatures, there is remarkable agreement between models and reconstructions. For other diagnostics, such as the regional response to volcanic eruptions, or hemispheric temperature differences, substantial disagreements between data and models have been reported. Here, we assess the potential sources of these discrepancies by comparing 1000-year hemispheric temperature reconstructions based on real-world paleoclimate proxies with climate-model-based pseudoproxies. These pseudoproxy experiments (PPE) indicate that noise inherent in proxy records and the unequal spatial distribution of proxy data are the key factors in explaining the data-model differences. For example, lower inter-hemispheric correlations in reconstructions can be fully accounted for by these factors in the PPE. Noise and data sampling also partly explain the reduced amplitude of the response to external forcing in reconstructions compared to models. For other metrics, such as inter-hemispheric differences, some, although reduced, discrepancy remains. Our results suggest that improving proxy data quality and spatial coverage is the key factor to increase the quality of future climate reconstructions, while the total number of proxy records and reconstruction methodology play a smaller role."},{"id":2802337287,"microsoftAcademicId":2802337287,"doi":"10.5194/cp-14-527-2018","title":"Spatio-temporal variability of Arctic summer temperatures over the past 2 millennia","authors":[{"LN":"Werner","FN":"Johannes P."},{"LN":"Divine","FN":"Dmitry V."},{"LN":"Divine","FN":"Dmitry V."},{"LN":"Ljungqvist","FN":"Fredrik Charpentier"},{"LN":"Nilsen","FN":"Tine"},{"LN":"Francus","FN":"Pierre"}],"year":2018,"journal":"Climate of The Past","references":[1520428197,1867005924,2025720061,2117443107,2107733948,2065232353,2024417959,2096830549,2135496572,2160036711,1830138900,2123559861,1948827418,2170171286,2122809335,2020767027,2099416373,2142987884,2116030881,2299597119,2178242555,1532349165,2062457444,2119689998,185797722,2011806334,2129931697,1969764636,2289190183,2100055302,2169784278,2043278879,2125834098,2624462411,2105942117,2121311122,2329499864,2032072047,2104440722,2161680946,1989241928,2159252479,2155142364,2121138676,1971880248,2088668253,2166529422,2122114567,2022729526,1826016929,1976810938,2158794134,2145861670,2730628963,2094444468,2804068631,2109378699,2118960317,2467008671,1851524102,2012623757,2137101078,2013828546,2158317250,2116686897,2080387613,2043479942,2313381310,2099679592,1648138309,2049168373,2086060322,2057868074,2561238029,1972094069,904621797,2168115048,2132867692,2150749664,1980730034,2150348651,2117102018,2002101446,2110915584,2149192442,2150583179,2023151740,2043212204,2285664460,1780033858,1875860844,2043440997,2126509979,1971454109,2149533233,2068335207,2033966124,2113160236,2768951849,2210438912,2161925367,2286293573,2062610749,2034765376,2046775047,2770824587,2139997679,2810560761,2092369677,2791681693,2740346623],"citationsCount":12,"abstract":"In this article, the first spatially resolved and millennium-length summer (June–August) temperature reconstruction over the Arctic and sub-Arctic domain (north of 60° N) is presented. It is based on a set of 44 annually dated temperature-sensitive proxy archives of various types from the revised PAGES2k database supplemented with six new recently updated proxy records. As a major advance, an extension of the Bayesian BARCAST climate field (CF) reconstruction technique provides a means to treat climate archives with dating uncertainties. This results not only in a more precise reconstruction but additionally enables joint probabilistic constraints to be imposed on the chronologies of the used archives. The new seasonal CF reconstruction for the Arctic region can be shown to be skilful for the majority of the terrestrial nodes. The decrease in the proxy data density back in time, however, limits the analyses in the spatial domain to the period after 750 CE, while the spatially averaged reconstruction covers the entire time interval of 1–2002 CE.<br>The centennial to millennial evolution of the reconstructed temperature is in good agreement with a general pattern that was inferred in recent studies for the Arctic and its subregions. In particular, the reconstruction shows a pronounced Medieval Climate Anomaly (MCA; here ca. 920–1060 CE), which was characterised by a sequence of extremely warm decades over the whole domain. The medieval warming was followed by a gradual cooling into the Little Ice Age (LIA), with 1766–1865 CE as the longest centennial-scale cold period, culminating around 1811–1820 CE for most of the target region.<br>In total over 600 independent realisations of the temperature CF were generated. As showcased for local and regional trends and temperature anomalies, operating in a probabilistic framework directly results in comprehensive uncertainty estimates, even for complex analyses. For the presented multi-scale trend analysis, for example, the spread in different paths across the reconstruction ensemble prevents a robust analysis of features at timescales shorter than ca. 30 years. For the spatial reconstruction, the benefit of using the spatially resolved reconstruction ensemble is demonstrated by focusing on the regional expression of the recent warming and the MCA. While our analysis shows that the peak MCA summer temperatures were as high as in the late 20th and early 21st centuries, the spatial coherence of extreme years over the last decades of the reconstruction (1980s onwards) seems unprecedented at least back until 750 CE. However, statistical testing could not provide conclusive support of the contemporary warming to exceed the peak of the MCA in terms of the pan-Arctic mean summer temperatures: the reconstruction cannot be extended reliably past 2002 CE due to lack of proxy data and thus the most recent warming is not captured."},{"id":2275791167,"microsoftAcademicId":2275791167,"doi":"10.1038/ngeo2566","title":"Corrigendum: Continental-scale temperature variability during the past two millennia","authors":[{"LN":"Ahmed","FN":"Moinuddin"},{"LN":"Anchukaitis","FN":"Kevin J."},{"LN":"Asrat","FN":"Asfawossen"},{"LN":"Borgaonkar","FN":"Hemant P."},{"LN":"Braida","FN":"Martina"},{"LN":"Buckley","FN":"Brendan M."},{"LN":"Büntgen","FN":"Ulf"},{"LN":"Chase","FN":"Brian M."},{"LN":"Christie","FN":"Duncan A."},{"LN":"Cook","FN":"Edward R."},{"LN":"Curran","FN":"Mark A.

This study addresses the possibility of carrying out spatially resolved global reconstructions of annual mean temperature using a worldwide network of proxy records and a method based on the search of analogues. Several variants of the method are evaluated, and their performance is analysed. As a test bed for the reconstruction, the PAGES 2k proxy database (version 1.9.0) is employed as a predictor, the HadCRUT4 dataset is the set of observations used as the predictand and target, and a set of simulations from the PMIP3 simulations are used as a pool to draw analogues and carry out pseudo-proxy experiments (PPEs). The performance of the variants of the analogue method (AM) is evaluated through a series of PPEs in growing complexity, from a perfect-proxy scenario to a realistic one where the pseudo-proxy records are contaminated with noise (white and red) and missing values, mimicking the limitations of actual proxies. Additionally, the method is tested by reconstructing the real observed HadCRUT4 temperature based on the calibration of real proxies. The reconstructed fields reproduce the observed decadal temperature variability. From all the tests, we can conclude that the analogue pool provided by the PMIP3 ensemble is large enough to reconstruct global annual temperatures during the Common Era. Furthermore, the search of analogues based on a metric that minimises the RMSE in real space outperforms other evaluated metrics, including the search of analogues in the range-reduced space expanded by the leading empirical orthogonal functions (EOFs). These results show how the AM is able to spatially extrapolate the information of a network of local proxy records to produce a homogeneous gap-free climate field reconstruction with valuable information in areas barely covered by proxies and make the AM a suitable tool to produce valuable climate field reconstructions for the Common Era."},{"id":2796310947,"microsoftAcademicId":2796310947,"doi":"10.1029/2010wr009832","title":"An experimental streamflow reconstruction for the River Murray, Australia, 1783-1988: STREAMFLOW RECONSTRUCTION, RIVER MURRAY","authors":[{"LN":"Gallant","FN":"Ailie J.

This technique, using wavelet transformation, makes the most of the available palaeoclimate data. The resulting reconstruction supports the case that multicentennial natural variability has been larger than is commonly thought, and that considerable natural climate variation can be expected in future. High temperatures occurred during the tenth century and notable ‘lows’ around 1600. But post-1990 temperatures stand out still as higher than at any time in the previous 2,000 years. A number of reconstructions of millennial-scale climate variability have been carried out in order to understand patterns of natural climate variability, on decade to century timescales, and the role of anthropogenic forcing1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8. These reconstructions have mainly used tree-ring data and other data sets of annual to decadal resolution. Lake and ocean sediments have a lower time resolution, but provide climate information at multicentennial timescales that may not be captured by tree-ring data9,10. Here we reconstruct Northern Hemisphere temperatures for the past 2,000 years by combining low-resolution proxies with tree-ring data, using a wavelet transform technique11 to achieve timescale-dependent processing of the data. Our reconstruction shows larger multicentennial variability than most previous multi-proxy reconstructions1,2,3,4,7, but agrees well with temperatures reconstructed from borehole measurements12 and with temperatures obtained with a general circulation model13,14. According to our reconstruction, high temperatures—similar to those observed in the twentieth century before 1990—occurred around ad 1000 to 1100, and minimum temperatures that are about 0.7 K below the average of 1961–90 occurred around ad 1600.

We focus on changes over the past 1 to 2 millennia. We assess reconstructions and modeling studies analyzing a number of different climate fields, including atmospheric circulation diagnostics, precipitation, and drought. We devote particular attention to proxy-based reconstructions of temperature patterns in past centuries, which place recent large-scale warming in an appropriate longer-term context. Our assessment affirms the conclusion that late 20th century warmth is unprecedented at hemispheric and, likely, global scales. There is more tentative evidence that particular modes of climate variability, such as the El Nino/Southern Oscillation and the North Atlantic Oscillation, may have exhibited late 20th century behavior that is anomalous in a long-term context. Regional conclusions, particularly for the Southern Hemisphere and parts of the tropics where high-resolution proxy data are sparse, are more circumspect. The dramatic differences between regional and hemispheric/global past trends, and the distinction between changes in surface temperature and precipitation/drought fields, underscore the limited utility in the use of terms such as the “Little Ice Age” and “Medieval Warm Period” for describing past climate epochs during the last millennium. Comparison of empirical evidence with proxy-based reconstructions demonstrates that natural factors appear to explain relatively well the major surface temperature changes of the past millennium through the 19th century (including hemispheric means and some spatial patterns).

A comprehensive set of uncertainty estimates has been derived to accompany the data: Estimates of measurement and sampling error, temperature bias effects, and the effect of limited observational coverage on large-scale averages have all been made.
